###### 1 
Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. 

###### 2 
And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. 

###### 3 
His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. 

###### 4 
And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. 

###### 5 
But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. 

###### 6 
He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. 

###### 7 
Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you." 

###### 8 
So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. 

###### 9 
And behold, Jesus met them and said, **"Greetings!"** And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. 

###### 10 
Then Jesus said to them, **"Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me."** ## The Report of the Guard 

###### 11 
While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place. 

###### 12 
And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers 

###### 13 
and said, "Tell people, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.' 

###### 14 
And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble." 

###### 15 
So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day. ## The Great Commission 

###### 16 
Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. 

###### 17 
And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. 

###### 18 
And Jesus came and said to them, **"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.** 

###### 19 
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 

###### 20 
teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
