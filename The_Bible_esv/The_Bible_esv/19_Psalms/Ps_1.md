###### 1 
Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers; 

###### 2 
but his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. 

###### 3 
He is like a tree planted by streams of water that yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does, he prospers. 

###### 4 
The wicked are not so, but are like chaff that the wind drives away. 

###### 5 
Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous; 

###### 6 
for the LORD knows the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will perish. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
