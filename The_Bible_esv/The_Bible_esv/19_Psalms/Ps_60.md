###### 1 
O God, you have rejected us, broken our defenses; you have been angry; oh, restore us. 

###### 2 
You have made the land to quake; you have torn it open; repair its breaches, for it totters. 

###### 3 
You have made your people see hard things; you have given us wine to drink that made us stagger. 

###### 4 
You have set up a banner for those who fear you, that they may flee to it from the bow. Selah 

###### 5 
That your beloved ones may be delivered, give salvation by your right hand and answer us! 

###### 6 
God has spoken in his holiness: "With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Vale of Succoth. 

###### 7 
Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet; Judah is my scepter. 

###### 8 
Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph." 

###### 9 
Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 

###### 10 
Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go forth, O God, with our armies. 

###### 11 
Oh, grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man! 

###### 12 
With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.
