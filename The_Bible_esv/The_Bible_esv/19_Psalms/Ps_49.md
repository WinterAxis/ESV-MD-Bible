###### 1 
Hear this, all peoples! Give ear, all inhabitants of the world, 

###### 2 
both low and high, rich and poor together! 

###### 3 
My mouth shall speak wisdom; the meditation of my heart shall be understanding. 

###### 4 
I will incline my ear to a proverb; I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre. 

###### 5 
Why should I fear in times of trouble, when the iniquity of those who cheat me surrounds me, 

###### 6 
those who trust in their wealth and boast of the abundance of their riches? 

###### 7 
Truly no man can ransom another, or give to God the price of his life, 

###### 8 
for the ransom of their life is costly and can never suffice, 

###### 9 
that he should live on forever and never see the pit. 

###### 10 
For he sees that even the wise die; the fool and the stupid alike must perish and leave their wealth to others. 

###### 11 
Their graves are their homes forever, their dwelling places to all generations, though they called lands by their own names. 

###### 12 
Man in his pomp will not remain; he is like the beasts that perish. 

###### 13 
This is the path of those who have foolish confidence; yet after them people approve of their boasts. Selah 

###### 14 
Like sheep they are appointed for Sheol; death shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall rule over them in the morning. Their form shall be consumed in Sheol, with no place to dwell. 

###### 15 
But God will ransom my soul from the power of Sheol, for he will receive me. Selah 

###### 16 
Be not afraid when a man becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases. 

###### 17 
For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not go down after him. 

###### 18 
For though, while he lives, he counts himself blessed --and though you get praise when you do well for yourself-- 

###### 19 
his soul will go to the generation of his fathers, who will never again see light. 

###### 20 
Man in his pomp yet without understanding is like the beasts that perish. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
