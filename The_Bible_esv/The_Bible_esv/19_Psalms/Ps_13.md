###### 1 
How long, O LORD? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? 

###### 2 
How long must I take counsel in my soul and have sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall my enemy be exalted over me? 

###### 3 
Consider and answer me, O LORD my God; light up my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death, 

###### 4 
lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed over him," lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken. 

###### 5 
But I have trusted in your steadfast love; my heart shall rejoice in your salvation. 

###### 6 
I will sing to the LORD, because he has dealt bountifully with me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
