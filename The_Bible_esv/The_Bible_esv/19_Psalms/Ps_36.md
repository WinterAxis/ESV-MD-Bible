###### 1 
Transgression speaks to the wicked deep in his heart; there is no fear of God before his eyes. 

###### 2 
For he flatters himself in his own eyes that his iniquity cannot be found out and hated. 

###### 3 
The words of his mouth are trouble and deceit; he has ceased to act wisely and do good. 

###### 4 
He plots trouble while on his bed; he sets himself in a way that is not good; he does not reject evil. 

###### 5 
Your steadfast love, O LORD, extends to the heavens, your faithfulness to the clouds. 

###### 6 
Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; your judgments are like the great deep; man and beast you save, O LORD. 

###### 7 
How precious is your steadfast love, O God! The children of mankind take refuge in the shadow of your wings. 

###### 8 
They feast on the abundance of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights. 

###### 9 
For with you is the fountain of life; in your light do we see light. 

###### 10 
Oh, continue your steadfast love to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright of heart! 

###### 11 
Let not the foot of arrogance come upon me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away. 

###### 12 
There the evildoers lie fallen; they are thrust down, unable to rise.
