###### 1 
And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
"Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, I am the LORD your God. 

###### 3 
You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, where you lived, and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan, to which I am bringing you. You shall not walk in their statutes. 

###### 4 
You shall follow my rules and keep my statutes and walk in them. I am the LORD your God. 

###### 5 
You shall therefore keep my statutes and my rules; if a person does them, he shall live by them: I am the LORD. 

###### 6 
"None of you shall approach any one of his close relatives to uncover nakedness. I am the LORD. 

###### 7 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, which is the nakedness of your mother; she is your mother, you shall not uncover her nakedness. 

###### 8 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife; it is your father's nakedness. 

###### 9 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, your father's daughter or your mother's daughter, whether brought up in the family or in another home. 

###### 10 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son's daughter or of your daughter's daughter, for their nakedness is your own nakedness. 

###### 11 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife's daughter, brought up in your father's family, since she is your sister. 

###### 12 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister; she is your father's relative. 

###### 13 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister, for she is your mother's relative. 

###### 14 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother, that is, you shall not approach his wife; she is your aunt. 

###### 15 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son's wife, you shall not uncover her nakedness. 

###### 16 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife; it is your brother's nakedness. 

###### 17 
You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and of her daughter, and you shall not take her son's daughter or her daughter's daughter to uncover her nakedness; they are relatives; it is depravity. 

###### 18 
And you shall not take a woman as a rival wife to her sister, uncovering her nakedness while her sister is still alive. 

###### 19 
"You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness while she is in her menstrual uncleanness. 

###### 20 
And you shall not lie sexually with your neighbor's wife and so make yourself unclean with her. 

###### 21 
You shall not give any of your children to offer them to Molech, and so profane the name of your God: I am the LORD. 

###### 22 
You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. 

###### 23 
And you shall not lie with any animal and so make yourself unclean with it, neither shall any woman give herself to an animal to lie with it: it is perversion. 

###### 24 
"Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these things, for by all these the nations I am driving out before you have become unclean, 

###### 25 
and the land became unclean, so that I punished its iniquity, and the land vomited out its inhabitants. 

###### 26 
But you shall keep my statutes and my rules and do none of these abominations, either the native or the stranger who sojourns among you 

###### 27 
(for the people of the land, who were before you, did all of these abominations, so that the land became unclean), 

###### 28 
lest the land vomit you out when you make it unclean, as it vomited out the nation that was before you. 

###### 29 
For everyone who does any of these abominations, the persons who do them shall be cut off from among their people. 

###### 30 
So keep my charge never to practice any of these abominable customs that were practiced before you, and never to make yourselves unclean by them: I am the LORD your God." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
