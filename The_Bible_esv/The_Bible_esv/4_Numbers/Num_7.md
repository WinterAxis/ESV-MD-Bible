On the day when Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle and had anointed and consecrated it with all its furnishings and had anointed and consecrated the altar with all its utensils,

"Accept these from them, that they may be used in the service of the tent of meeting, and give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service."
