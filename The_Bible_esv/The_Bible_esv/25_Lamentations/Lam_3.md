###### 1 
I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of his wrath; 

###### 2 
he has driven and brought me into darkness without any light; 

###### 3 
surely against me he turns his hand again and again the whole day long. 

###### 4 
He has made my flesh and my skin waste away; he has broken my bones; 

###### 5 
he has besieged and enveloped me with bitterness and tribulation; 

###### 6 
he has made me dwell in darkness like the dead of long ago. 

###### 7 
He has walled me about so that I cannot escape; he has made my chains heavy; 

###### 8 
though I call and cry for help, he shuts out my prayer; 

###### 9 
he has blocked my ways with blocks of stones; he has made my paths crooked. 

###### 10 
He is a bear lying in wait for me, a lion in hiding; 

###### 11 
he turned aside my steps and tore me to pieces; he has made me desolate; 

###### 12 
he bent his bow and set me as a target for his arrow. 

###### 13 
He drove into my kidneys the arrows of his quiver; 

###### 14 
I have become the laughingstock of all peoples, the object of their taunts all day long. 

###### 15 
He has filled me with bitterness; he has sated me with wormwood. 

###### 16 
He has made my teeth grind on gravel, and made me cower in ashes; 

###### 17 
my soul is bereft of peace; I have forgotten what happiness is; 

###### 18 
so I say, "My endurance has perished; so has my hope from the LORD." 

###### 19 
Remember my affliction and my wanderings, the wormwood and the gall! 

###### 20 
My soul continually remembers it and is bowed down within me. 

###### 21 
But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: 

###### 22 
The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; 

###### 23 
they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness. 

###### 24 
"The LORD is my portion," says my soul, "therefore I will hope in him." 

###### 25 
The LORD is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him. 

###### 26 
It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD. 

###### 27 
It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 

###### 28 
Let him sit alone in silence when it is laid on him; 

###### 29 
let him put his mouth in the dust-- there may yet be hope; 

###### 30 
let him give his cheek to the one who strikes, and let him be filled with insults. 

###### 31 
For the Lord will not cast off forever, 

###### 32 
but, though he cause grief, he will have compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast love; 

###### 33 
for he does not afflict from his heart or grieve the children of men. 

###### 34 
To crush underfoot all the prisoners of the earth, 

###### 35 
to deny a man justice in the presence of the Most High, 

###### 36 
to subvert a man in his lawsuit, the Lord does not approve. 

###### 37 
Who has spoken and it came to pass, unless the Lord has commanded it? 

###### 38 
Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that good and bad come? 

###### 39 
Why should a living man complain, a man, about the punishment of his sins? 

###### 40 
Let us test and examine our ways, and return to the LORD! 

###### 41 
Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven: 

###### 42 
"We have transgressed and rebelled, and you have not forgiven. 

###### 43 
"You have wrapped yourself with anger and pursued us, killing without pity; 

###### 44 
you have wrapped yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through. 

###### 45 
You have made us scum and garbage among the peoples. 

###### 46 
"All our enemies open their mouths against us; 

###### 47 
panic and pitfall have come upon us, devastation and destruction; 

###### 48 
my eyes flow with rivers of tears because of the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

###### 49 
"My eyes will flow without ceasing, without respite, 

###### 50 
until the LORD from heaven looks down and sees; 

###### 51 
my eyes cause me grief at the fate of all the daughters of my city. 

###### 52 
"I have been hunted like a bird by those who were my enemies without cause; 

###### 53 
they flung me alive into the pit and cast stones on me; 

###### 54 
water closed over my head; I said, 'I am lost.' 

###### 55 
"I called on your name, O LORD, from the depths of the pit; 

###### 56 
you heard my plea, 'Do not close your ear to my cry for help!' 

###### 57 
You came near when I called on you; you said, 'Do not fear!' 

###### 58 
"You have taken up my cause, O Lord; you have redeemed my life. 

###### 59 
You have seen the wrong done to me, O LORD; judge my cause. 

###### 60 
You have seen all their vengeance, all their plots against me. 

###### 61 
"You have heard their taunts, O LORD, all their plots against me. 

###### 62 
The lips and thoughts of my assailants are against me all the day long. 

###### 63 
Behold their sitting and their rising; I am the object of their taunts. 

###### 64 
"You will repay them, O LORD, according to the work of their hands. 

###### 65 
You will give them dullness of heart; your curse will be on them. 

###### 66 
You will pursue them in anger and destroy them from under your heavens, O LORD."
