###### 1 
Remember, O LORD, what has befallen us; look, and see our disgrace! 

###### 2 
Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to foreigners. 

###### 3 
We have become orphans, fatherless; our mothers are like widows. 

###### 4 
We must pay for the water we drink; the wood we get must be bought. 

###### 5 
Our pursuers are at our necks; we are weary; we are given no rest. 

###### 6 
We have given the hand to Egypt, and to Assyria, to get bread enough. 

###### 7 
Our fathers sinned, and are no more; and we bear their iniquities. 

###### 8 
Slaves rule over us; there is none to deliver us from their hand. 

###### 9 
We get our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the wilderness. 

###### 10 
Our skin is hot as an oven with the burning heat of famine. 

###### 11 
Women are raped in Zion, young women in the towns of Judah. 

###### 12 
Princes are hung up by their hands; no respect is shown to the elders. 

###### 13 
Young men are compelled to grind at the mill, and boys stagger under loads of wood. 

###### 14 
The old men have left the city gate, the young men their music. 

###### 15 
The joy of our hearts has ceased; our dancing has been turned to mourning. 

###### 16 
The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned! 

###### 17 
For this our heart has become sick, for these things our eyes have grown dim, 

###### 18 
for Mount Zion which lies desolate; jackals prowl over it. 

###### 19 
But you, O LORD, reign forever; your throne endures to all generations. 

###### 20 
Why do you forget us forever, why do you forsake us for so many days? 

###### 21 
Restore us to yourself, O LORD, that we may be restored! Renew our days as of old-- 

###### 22 
unless you have utterly rejected us, and you remain exceedingly angry with us.
