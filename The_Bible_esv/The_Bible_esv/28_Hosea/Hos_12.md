###### 1 
Ephraim feeds on the wind and pursues the east wind all day long; they multiply falsehood and violence; they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried to Egypt. ## The LORD's Indictment of Israel and Judah 

###### 2 
The LORD has an indictment against Judah and will punish Jacob according to his ways; he will repay him according to his deeds. 

###### 3 
In the womb he took his brother by the heel, and in his manhood he strove with God. 

###### 4 
He strove with the angel and prevailed; he wept and sought his favor. He met God at Bethel, and there God spoke with us-- 

###### 5 
the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD is his memorial name: 

###### 6 
"So you, by the help of your God, return, hold fast to love and justice, and wait continually for your God." 

###### 7 
A merchant, in whose hands are false balances, he loves to oppress. 

###### 8 
Ephraim has said, "Ah, but I am rich; I have found wealth for myself; in all my labors they cannot find in me iniquity or sin." 

###### 9 
I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt; I will again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed feast. 

###### 10 
I spoke to the prophets; it was I who multiplied visions, and through the prophets gave parables. 

###### 11 
If there is iniquity in Gilead, they shall surely come to nothing: in Gilgal they sacrifice bulls; their altars also are like stone heaps on the furrows of the field. 

###### 12 
Jacob fled to the land of Aram; there Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he guarded sheep. 

###### 13 
By a prophet the LORD brought Israel up from Egypt, and by a prophet he was guarded. 

###### 14 
Ephraim has given bitter provocation; so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him and will repay him for his disgraceful deeds.
