###### 1 
What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? 

###### 2 
You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask. 

###### 3 
You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. 

###### 4 
You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 

###### 5 
Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, "He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us"? 

###### 6 
But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble." 

###### 7 
Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 

###### 8 
Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. 

###### 9 
Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. 

###### 10 
Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you. 

###### 11 
Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. 

###### 12 
There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor? ## Boasting About Tomorrow 

###### 13 
Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit"-- 

###### 14 
yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. 

###### 15 
Instead you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that." 

###### 16 
As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. 

###### 17 
So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.
