###### 1 
For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles-- 

###### 2 
assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you, 

###### 3 
how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have written briefly. 

###### 4 
When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ, 

###### 5 
which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit. 

###### 6 
This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel. 

###### 7 
Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace, which was given me by the working of his power. 

###### 8 
To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, 

###### 9 
and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things, 

###### 10 
so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. 

###### 11 
This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, 

###### 12 
in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him. 

###### 13 
So I ask you not to lose heart over what I am suffering for you, which is your glory. ## Prayer for Spiritual Strength 

###### 14 
For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, 

###### 15 
from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, 

###### 16 
that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, 

###### 17 
so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith--that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 

###### 18 
may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 

###### 19 
and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. 

###### 20 
Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, 

###### 21 
to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
