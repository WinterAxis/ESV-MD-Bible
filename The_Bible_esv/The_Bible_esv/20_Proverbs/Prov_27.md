***


###### 1 
Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring. 

###### 2 
Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips. 

###### 3 
A stone is heavy, and sand is weighty, but a fool's provocation is heavier than both. 

###### 4 
Wrath is cruel, anger is overwhelming, but who can stand before jealousy? 

###### 5 
Better is open rebuke than hidden love. 

###### 6 
Faithful are the wounds of a friend; profuse are the kisses of an enemy. 

###### 7 
One who is full loathes honey, but to one who is hungry everything bitter is sweet. 

###### 8 
Like a bird that strays from its nest is a man who strays from his home. 

###### 9 
Oil and perfume make the heart glad, and the sweetness of a friend comes from his earnest counsel. 

###### 10 
Do not forsake your friend and your father's friend, and do not go to your brother's house in the day of your calamity. Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother who is far away. 

###### 11 
Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him who reproaches me. 

###### 12 
The prudent sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it. 

###### 13 
Take a man's garment when he has put up security for a stranger, and hold it in pledge when he puts up security for an adulteress. 

###### 14 
Whoever blesses his neighbor with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, will be counted as cursing. 

###### 15 
A continual dripping on a rainy day and a quarrelsome wife are alike; 

###### 16 
to restrain her is to restrain the wind or to grasp oil in one's right hand. 

###### 17 
Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another. 

###### 18 
Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who guards his master will be honored. 

###### 19 
As in water face reflects face, so the heart of man reflects the man. 

###### 20 
Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, and never satisfied are the eyes of man. 

###### 21 
The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold, and a man is tested by his praise. 

###### 22 
Crush a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain, yet his folly will not depart from him. 

###### 23 
Know well the condition of your flocks, and give attention to your herds, 

###### 24 
for riches do not last forever; and does a crown endure to all generations? 

###### 25 
When the grass is gone and the new growth appears and the vegetation of the mountains is gathered, 

###### 26 
the lambs will provide your clothing, and the goats the price of a field. 

###### 27 
There will be enough goats' milk for your food, for the food of your household and maintenance for your girls. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
