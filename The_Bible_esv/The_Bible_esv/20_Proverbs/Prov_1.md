###### 1 
The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel: 

###### 2 
To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight, 

###### 3 
to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity; 

###### 4 
to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the youth-- 

###### 5 
Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance, 

###### 6 
to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles. 

###### 7 
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction. ## The Enticement of Sinners 

###### 8 
Hear, my son, your father's instruction, and forsake not your mother's teaching, 

###### 9 
for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck. 

###### 10 
My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent. 

###### 11 
If they say, "Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without reason; 

###### 12 
like Sheol let us swallow them alive, and whole, like those who go down to the pit; 

###### 13 
we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with plunder; 

###### 14 
throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse"-- 

###### 15 
my son, do not walk in the way with them; hold back your foot from their paths, 

###### 16 
for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood. 

###### 17 
For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird, 

###### 18 
but these men lie in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives. 

###### 19 
Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain; it takes away the life of its possessors. ## The Call of Wisdom 

###### 20 
Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice; 

###### 21 
at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks: 

###### 22 
"How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge? 

###### 23 
If you turn at my reproof, behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you. 

###### 24 
Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded, 

###### 25 
because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof, 

###### 26 
I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when terror strikes you, 

###### 27 
when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you. 

###### 28 
Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me. 

###### 29 
Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD, 

###### 30 
would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof, 

###### 31 
therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices. 

###### 32 
For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them; 

###### 33 
but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster."
