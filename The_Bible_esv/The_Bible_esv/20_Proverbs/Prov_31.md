###### 1 
The words of King Lemuel. An oracle that his mother taught him: 

###### 2 
What are you doing, my son? What are you doing, son of my womb? What are you doing, son of my vows? 

###### 3 
Do not give your strength to women, your ways to those who destroy kings. 

###### 4 
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to take strong drink, 

###### 5 
lest they drink and forget what has been decreed and pervert the rights of all the afflicted. 

###### 6 
Give strong drink to the one who is perishing, and wine to those in bitter distress; 

###### 7 
let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more. 

###### 8 
Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute. 

###### 9 
Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy. ## The Woman Who Fears the LORD 

###### 10 
An excellent wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels. 

###### 11 
The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain. 

###### 12 
She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life. 

###### 13 
She seeks wool and flax, and works with willing hands. 

###### 14 
She is like the ships of the merchant; she brings her food from afar. 

###### 15 
She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household and portions for her maidens. 

###### 16 
She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard. 

###### 17 
She dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong. 

###### 18 
She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night. 

###### 19 
She puts her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle. 

###### 20 
She opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy. 

###### 21 
She is not afraid of snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet. 

###### 22 
She makes bed coverings for herself; her clothing is fine linen and purple. 

###### 23 
Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land. 

###### 24 
She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers sashes to the merchant. 

###### 25 
Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come. 

###### 26 
She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue. 

###### 27 
She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. 

###### 28 
Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: 

###### 29 
"Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all." 

###### 30 
Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. 

###### 31 
Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates.
