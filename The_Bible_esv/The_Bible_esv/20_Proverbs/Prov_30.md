###### 1 
The words of Agur son of Jakeh. The oracle. The man declares, I am weary, O God; I am weary, O God, and worn out. 

###### 2 
Surely I am too stupid to be a man. I have not the understanding of a man. 

###### 3 
I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the Holy One. 

###### 4 
Who has ascended to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in his fists? Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name? Surely you know! 

###### 5 
Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. 

###### 6 
Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar. 

###### 7 
Two things I ask of you; deny them not to me before I die: 

###### 8 
Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me, 

###### 9 
lest I be full and deny you and say, "Who is the LORD?" or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God. 

###### 10 
Do not slander a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you be held guilty. 

###### 11 
There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers. 

###### 12 
There are those who are clean in their own eyes but are not washed of their filth. 

###### 13 
There are those--how lofty are their eyes, how high their eyelids lift! 

###### 14 
There are those whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, the needy from among mankind. 

###### 15 
The leech has two daughters: Give and Give. Three things are never satisfied; four never say, "Enough": 

###### 16 
Sheol, the barren womb, the land never satisfied with water, and the fire that never says, "Enough." 

###### 17 
The eye that mocks a father and scorns to obey a mother will be picked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures. 

###### 18 
Three things are too wonderful for me; four I do not understand: 

###### 19 
the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a virgin. 

###### 20 
This is the way of an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, "I have done no wrong." 

###### 21 
Under three things the earth trembles; under four it cannot bear up: 

###### 22 
a slave when he becomes king, and a fool when he is filled with food; 

###### 23 
an unloved woman when she gets a husband, and a maidservant when she displaces her mistress. 

###### 24 
Four things on earth are small, but they are exceedingly wise: 

###### 25 
the ants are a people not strong, yet they provide their food in the summer; 

###### 26 
the rock badgers are a people not mighty, yet they make their homes in the cliffs; 

###### 27 
the locusts have no king, yet all of them march in rank; 

###### 28 
the lizard you can take in your hands, yet it is in kings' palaces. 

###### 29 
Three things are stately in their tread; four are stately in their stride: 

###### 30 
the lion, which is mightiest among beasts and does not turn back before any; 

###### 31 
the strutting rooster, the he-goat, and a king whose army is with him. 

###### 32 
If you have been foolish, exalting yourself, or if you have been devising evil, put your hand on your mouth. 

###### 33 
For pressing milk produces curds, pressing the nose produces blood, and pressing anger produces strife. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
