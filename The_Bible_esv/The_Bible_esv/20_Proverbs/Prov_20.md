###### 1 
Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler, and whoever is led astray by it is not wise. 

###### 2

###### 3 
It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife, but every fool will be quarreling. 

###### 4 
The sluggard does not plow in the autumn; he will seek at harvest and have nothing. 

###### 5 
The purpose in a man's heart is like deep water, but a man of understanding will draw it out. 

###### 6 
Many a man proclaims his own steadfast love, but a faithful man who can find? 

###### 7 
The righteous who walks in his integrity-- blessed are his children after him! 

###### 8 
A king who sits on the throne of judgment winnows all evil with his eyes. 

###### 9 
Who can say, "I have made my heart pure; I am clean from my sin"? 

###### 10 
Unequal weights and unequal measures are both alike an abomination to the LORD. 

###### 11 
Even a child makes himself known by his acts, by whether his conduct is pure and upright. 

###### 12 
The hearing ear and the seeing eye, the LORD has made them both. 

###### 13 
Love not sleep, lest you come to poverty; open your eyes, and you will have plenty of bread. 

###### 14 
"Bad, bad," says the buyer, but when he goes away, then he boasts. 

###### 15 
There is gold and abundance of costly stones, but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel. 

###### 16 
Take a man's garment when he has put up security for a stranger, and hold it in pledge when he puts up security for foreigners. 

###### 17 
Bread gained by deceit is sweet to a man, but afterward his mouth will be full of gravel. 

###### 18 
Plans are established by counsel; by wise guidance wage war. 

###### 19 
Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets; therefore do not associate with a simple babbler. 

###### 20 
If one curses his father or his mother, his lamp will be put out in utter darkness. 

###### 21 
An inheritance gained hastily in the beginning will not be blessed in the end. 

###### 22 
Do not say, "I will repay evil"; wait for the LORD, and he will deliver you. 

###### 23 
Unequal weights are an abomination to the LORD, and false scales are not good. 

###### 24 
A man's steps are from the LORD; how then can man understand his way? 

###### 25 
It is a snare to say rashly, "It is holy," and to reflect only after making vows. 

###### 26 
A wise king winnows the wicked and drives the wheel over them. 

###### 27 
The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD, searching all his innermost parts. 

###### 28 
Steadfast love and faithfulness preserve the king, and by steadfast love his throne is upheld. 

###### 29 
The glory of young men is their strength, but the splendor of old men is their gray hair. 

###### 30 
Blows that wound cleanse away evil; strokes make clean the innermost parts.
