###### 1 
Better is a dry morsel with quiet than a house full of feasting with strife. 

###### 2 
A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who acts shamefully and will share the inheritance as one of the brothers. 

###### 3 
The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold, and the LORD tests hearts. 

###### 4 
An evildoer listens to wicked lips, and a liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue. 

###### 5 
Whoever mocks the poor insults his Maker; he who is glad at calamity will not go unpunished. 

###### 6 
Grandchildren are the crown of the aged, and the glory of children is their fathers. 

###### 7 
Fine speech is not becoming to a fool; still less is false speech to a prince. 

###### 8 
A bribe is like a magic stone in the eyes of the one who gives it; wherever he turns he prospers. 

###### 9 
Whoever covers an offense seeks love, but he who repeats a matter separates close friends. 

###### 10 
A rebuke goes deeper into a man of understanding than a hundred blows into a fool. 

###### 11 
An evil man seeks only rebellion, and a cruel messenger will be sent against him. 

###### 12 
Let a man meet a she-bear robbed of her cubs rather than a fool in his folly. 

###### 13 
If anyone returns evil for good, evil will not depart from his house. 

###### 14 
The beginning of strife is like letting out water, so quit before the quarrel breaks out. 

###### 15 
He who justifies the wicked and he who condemns the righteous are both alike an abomination to the LORD. 

###### 16 
Why should a fool have money in his hand to buy wisdom when he has no sense? 

###### 17 
A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. 

###### 18 
One who lacks sense gives a pledge and puts up security in the presence of his neighbor. 

###### 19 
Whoever loves transgression loves strife; he who makes his door high seeks destruction. 

###### 20 
A man of crooked heart does not discover good, and one with a dishonest tongue falls into calamity. 

###### 21 
He who sires a fool gets himself sorrow, and the father of a fool has no joy. 

###### 22 
A joyful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. 

###### 23 
The wicked accepts a bribe in secret to pervert the ways of justice. 

###### 24 
The discerning sets his face toward wisdom, but the eyes of a fool are on the ends of the earth. 

###### 25 
A foolish son is a grief to his father and bitterness to her who bore him. 

###### 26 
To impose a fine on a righteous man is not good, nor to strike the noble for their uprightness. 

###### 27 
Whoever restrains his words has knowledge, and he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding. 

###### 28 
Even a fool who keeps silent is considered wise; when he closes his lips, he is deemed intelligent. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
