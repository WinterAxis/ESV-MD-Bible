###### 1 
Whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire; he breaks out against all sound judgment. 

###### 2 
A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his opinion. 

###### 3 
When wickedness comes, contempt comes also, and with dishonor comes disgrace. 

###### 4 
The words of a man's mouth are deep waters; the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook. 

###### 5 
It is not good to be partial to the wicked or to deprive the righteous of justice. 

###### 6 
A fool's lips walk into a fight, and his mouth invites a beating. 

###### 7 
A fool's mouth is his ruin, and his lips are a snare to his soul. 

###### 8 
The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels; they go down into the inner parts of the body. 

###### 9 
Whoever is slack in his work is a brother to him who destroys. 

###### 10 
The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous man runs into it and is safe. 

###### 11 
A rich man's wealth is his strong city, and like a high wall in his imagination. 

###### 12 
Before destruction a man's heart is haughty, but humility comes before honor. 

###### 13 
If one gives an answer before he hears, it is his folly and shame. 

###### 14 
A man's spirit will endure sickness, but a crushed spirit who can bear? 

###### 15 
An intelligent heart acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge. 

###### 16 
A man's gift makes room for him and brings him before the great. 

###### 17 
The one who states his case first seems right, until the other comes and examines him. 

###### 18 
The lot puts an end to quarrels and decides between powerful contenders. 

###### 19 
A brother offended is more unyielding than a strong city, and quarreling is like the bars of a castle. 

###### 20 
From the fruit of a man's mouth his stomach is satisfied; he is satisfied by the yield of his lips. 

###### 21 
Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruits. 

###### 22 
He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the LORD. 

###### 23 
The poor use entreaties, but the rich answer roughly. 

###### 24 
A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
