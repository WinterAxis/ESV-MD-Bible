###### 1 
And Job again took up his discourse, and said: 

###### 2 
"As God lives, who has taken away my right, and the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter, 

###### 3 
as long as my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils, 

###### 4 
my lips will not speak falsehood, and my tongue will not utter deceit. 

###### 5 
Far be it from me to say that you are right; till I die I will not put away my integrity from me. 

###### 6 
I hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days. 

###### 7 
"Let my enemy be as the wicked, and let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous. 

###### 8 
For what is the hope of the godless when God cuts him off, when God takes away his life? 

###### 9 
Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him? 

###### 10 
Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times? 

###### 11 
I will teach you concerning the hand of God; what is with the Almighty I will not conceal. 

###### 12 
Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain? 

###### 13 
"This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage that oppressors receive from the Almighty: 

###### 14 
If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword, and his descendants have not enough bread. 

###### 15 
Those who survive him the pestilence buries, and his widows do not weep. 

###### 16 
Though he heap up silver like dust, and pile up clothing like clay, 

###### 17 
he may pile it up, but the righteous will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver. 

###### 18 
He builds his house like a moth's, like a booth that a watchman makes. 

###### 19 
He goes to bed rich, but will do so no more; he opens his eyes, and his wealth is gone. 

###### 20 
Terrors overtake him like a flood; in the night a whirlwind carries him off. 

###### 21 
The east wind lifts him up and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place. 

###### 22 
It hurls at him without pity; he flees from its power in headlong flight. 

###### 23 
It claps its hands at him and hisses at him from its place. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
