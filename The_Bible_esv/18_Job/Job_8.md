###### 1 
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: 

###### 2 
"How long will you say these things, and the words of your mouth be a great wind? 

###### 3 
Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert the right? 

###### 4 
If your children have sinned against him, he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression. 

###### 5 
If you will seek God and plead with the Almighty for mercy, 

###### 6 
if you are pure and upright, surely then he will rouse himself for you and restore your rightful habitation. 

###### 7 
And though your beginning was small, your latter days will be very great. 

###### 8 
"For inquire, please, of bygone ages, and consider what the fathers have searched out. 

###### 9 
For we are but of yesterday and know nothing, for our days on earth are a shadow. 

###### 10 
Will they not teach you and tell you and utter words out of their understanding? 

###### 11 
"Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Can reeds flourish where there is no water? 

###### 12 
While yet in flower and not cut down, they wither before any other plant. 

###### 13 
Such are the paths of all who forget God; the hope of the godless shall perish. 

###### 14 
His confidence is severed, and his trust is a spider's web. 

###### 15 
He leans against his house, but it does not stand; he lays hold of it, but it does not endure. 

###### 16 
He is a lush plant before the sun, and his shoots spread over his garden. 

###### 17 
His roots entwine the stone heap; he looks upon a house of stones. 

###### 18 
If he is destroyed from his place, then it will deny him, saying, 'I have never seen you.' 

###### 19 
Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the soil others will spring. 

###### 20 
"Behold, God will not reject a blameless man, nor take the hand of evildoers. 

###### 21 
He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with shouting. 

###### 22 
Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
