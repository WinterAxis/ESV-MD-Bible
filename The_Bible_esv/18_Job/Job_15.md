###### 1 
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: 

###### 2 
"Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? 

###### 3 
Should he argue in unprofitable talk, or in words with which he can do no good? 

###### 4 
But you are doing away with the fear of God and hindering meditation before God. 

###### 5 
For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the tongue of the crafty. 

###### 6 
Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; your own lips testify against you. 

###### 7 
"Are you the first man who was born? Or were you brought forth before the hills? 

###### 8 
Have you listened in the council of God? And do you limit wisdom to yourself? 

###### 9 
What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that is not clear to us? 

###### 10 
Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us, older than your father. 

###### 11 
Are the comforts of God too small for you, or the word that deals gently with you? 

###### 12 
Why does your heart carry you away, and why do your eyes flash, 

###### 13 
that you turn your spirit against God and bring such words out of your mouth? 

###### 14 
What is man, that he can be pure? Or he who is born of a woman, that he can be righteous? 

###### 15 
Behold, God puts no trust in his holy ones, and the heavens are not pure in his sight; 

###### 16 
how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks injustice like water! 

###### 17 
"I will show you; hear me, and what I have seen I will declare 

###### 18 
(what wise men have told, without hiding it from their fathers, 

###### 19 
to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them). 

###### 20 
The wicked man writhes in pain all his days, through all the years that are laid up for the ruthless. 

###### 21 
Dreadful sounds are in his ears; in prosperity the destroyer will come upon him. 

###### 22 
He does not believe that he will return out of darkness, and he is marked for the sword. 

###### 23 
He wanders abroad for bread, saying, 'Where is it?' He knows that a day of darkness is ready at his hand; 

###### 24 
distress and anguish terrify him; they prevail against him, like a king ready for battle. 

###### 25 
Because he has stretched out his hand against God and defies the Almighty, 

###### 26 
running stubbornly against him with a thickly bossed shield; 

###### 27 
because he has covered his face with his fat and gathered fat upon his waist 

###### 28 
and has lived in desolate cities, in houses that none should inhabit, which were ready to become heaps of ruins; 

###### 29 
he will not be rich, and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the earth; 

###### 30 
he will not depart from darkness; the flame will dry up his shoots, and by the breath of his mouth he will depart. 

###### 31 
Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself, for emptiness will be his payment. 

###### 32 
It will be paid in full before his time, and his branch will not be green. 

###### 33 
He will shake off his unripe grape like the vine, and cast off his blossom like the olive tree. 

###### 34 
For the company of the godless is barren, and fire consumes the tents of bribery. 

###### 35 
They conceive trouble and give birth to evil, and their womb prepares deceit."
