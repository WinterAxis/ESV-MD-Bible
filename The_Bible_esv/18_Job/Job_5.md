###### 1 
"Call now; is there anyone who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn? 

###### 2 
Surely vexation kills the fool, and jealousy slays the simple. 

###### 3 
I have seen the fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling. 

###### 4 
His children are far from safety; they are crushed in the gate, and there is no one to deliver them. 

###### 5 
The hungry eat his harvest, and he takes it even out of thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth. 

###### 6 
For affliction does not come from the dust, nor does trouble sprout from the ground, 

###### 7 
but man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward. 

###### 8 
"As for me, I would seek God, and to God would I commit my cause, 

###### 9 
who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number: 

###### 10 
he gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the fields; 

###### 11 
he sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn are lifted to safety. 

###### 12 
He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success. 

###### 13 
He catches the wise in their own craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end. 

###### 14 
They meet with darkness in the daytime and grope at noonday as in the night. 

###### 15 
But he saves the needy from the sword of their mouth and from the hand of the mighty. 

###### 16 
So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts her mouth. 

###### 17 
"Behold, blessed is the one whom God reproves; therefore despise not the discipline of the Almighty. 

###### 18 
For he wounds, but he binds up; he shatters, but his hands heal. 

###### 19 
He will deliver you from six troubles; in seven no evil shall touch you. 

###### 20 
In famine he will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword. 

###### 21 
You shall be hidden from the lash of the tongue, and shall not fear destruction when it comes. 

###### 22 
At destruction and famine you shall laugh, and shall not fear the beasts of the earth. 

###### 23 
For you shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you. 

###### 24 
You shall know that your tent is at peace, and you shall inspect your fold and miss nothing. 

###### 25 
You shall know also that your offspring shall be many, and your descendants as the grass of the earth. 

###### 26 
You shall come to your grave in ripe old age, like a sheaf gathered up in its season. 

###### 27 
Behold, this we have searched out; it is true. Hear, and know it for your good." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
