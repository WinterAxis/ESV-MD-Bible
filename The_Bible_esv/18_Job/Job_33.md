###### 1 
"But now, hear my speech, O Job, and listen to all my words. 

###### 2 
Behold, I open my mouth; the tongue in my mouth speaks. 

###### 3 
My words declare the uprightness of my heart, and what my lips know they speak sincerely. 

###### 4 
The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life. 

###### 5 
Answer me, if you can; set your words in order before me; take your stand. 

###### 6 
Behold, I am toward God as you are; I too was pinched off from a piece of clay. 

###### 7 
Behold, no fear of me need terrify you; my pressure will not be heavy upon you. 

###### 8 
"Surely you have spoken in my ears, and I have heard the sound of your words. 

###### 9 
You say, 'I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, and there is no iniquity in me. 

###### 10 
Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me as his enemy, 

###### 11 
he puts my feet in the stocks and watches all my paths.' 

###### 12 
"Behold, in this you are not right. I will answer you, for God is greater than man. 

###### 13 
Why do you contend against him, saying, 'He will answer none of man's words'? 

###### 14 
For God speaks in one way, and in two, though man does not perceive it. 

###### 15 
In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, while they slumber on their beds, 

###### 16 
then he opens the ears of men and terrifies them with warnings, 

###### 17 
that he may turn man aside from his deed and conceal pride from a man; 

###### 18 
he keeps back his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword. 

###### 19 
"Man is also rebuked with pain on his bed and with continual strife in his bones, 

###### 20 
so that his life loathes bread, and his appetite the choicest food. 

###### 21 
His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out. 

###### 22 
His soul draws near the pit, and his life to those who bring death. 

###### 23 
If there be for him an angel, a mediator, one of the thousand, to declare to man what is right for him, 

###### 24 
and he is merciful to him, and says, 'Deliver him from going down into the pit; I have found a ransom; 

###### 25 
let his flesh become fresh with youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor'; 

###### 26 
then man prays to God, and he accepts him; he sees his face with a shout of joy, and he restores to man his righteousness. 

###### 27 
He sings before men and says: 'I sinned and perverted what was right, and it was not repaid to me. 

###### 28 
He has redeemed my soul from going down into the pit, and my life shall look upon the light.' 

###### 29 
"Behold, God does all these things, twice, three times, with a man, 

###### 30 
to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be lighted with the light of life. 

###### 31 
Pay attention, O Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak. 

###### 32 
If you have any words, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you. 

###### 33 
If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."
