###### 1 
So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. 

###### 2 
Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, burned with anger. He burned with anger at Job because he justified himself rather than God. 

###### 3 
He burned with anger also at Job's three friends because they had found no answer, although they had declared Job to be in the wrong. 

###### 4 
Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he. 

###### 5 
And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, he burned with anger. 

###### 6 
And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said: "I am young in years, and you are aged; therefore I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you. 

###### 7 
I said, 'Let days speak, and many years teach wisdom.' 

###### 8 
But it is the spirit in man, the breath of the Almighty, that makes him understand. 

###### 9 
It is not the old who are wise, nor the aged who understand what is right. 

###### 10 
Therefore I say, 'Listen to me; let me also declare my opinion.' 

###### 11 
"Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your wise sayings, while you searched out what to say. 

###### 12 
I gave you my attention, and, behold, there was none among you who refuted Job or who answered his words. 

###### 13 
Beware lest you say, 'We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not a man.' 

###### 14 
He has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your speeches. 

###### 15 
"They are dismayed; they answer no more; they have not a word to say. 

###### 16 
And shall I wait, because they do not speak, because they stand there, and answer no more? 

###### 17 
I also will answer with my share; I also will declare my opinion. 

###### 18 
For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me. 

###### 19 
Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent; like new wineskins ready to burst. 

###### 20 
I must speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer. 

###### 21 
I will not show partiality to any man or use flattery toward any person. 

###### 22 
For I do not know how to flatter, else my Maker would soon take me away.
