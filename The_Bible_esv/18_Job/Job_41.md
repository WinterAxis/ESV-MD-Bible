###### 1 
"Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook or press down his tongue with a cord? 

###### 2 
Can you put a rope in his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook? 

###### 3 
Will he make many pleas to you? Will he speak to you soft words? 

###### 4 
Will he make a covenant with you to take him for your servant forever? 

###### 5 
Will you play with him as with a bird, or will you put him on a leash for your girls? 

###### 6 
Will traders bargain over him? Will they divide him up among the merchants? 

###### 7 
Can you fill his skin with harpoons or his head with fishing spears? 

###### 8 
Lay your hands on him; remember the battle--you will not do it again! 

###### 9 
Behold, the hope of a man is false; he is laid low even at the sight of him. 

###### 10 
No one is so fierce that he dares to stir him up. Who then is he who can stand before me? 

###### 11 
Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heaven is mine. 

###### 12 
"I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, or his mighty strength, or his goodly frame. 

###### 13 
Who can strip off his outer garment? Who would come near him with a bridle? 

###### 14 
Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is terror. 

###### 15 
His back is made of rows of shields, shut up closely as with a seal. 

###### 16 
One is so near to another that no air can come between them. 

###### 17 
They are joined one to another; they clasp each other and cannot be separated. 

###### 18 
His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn. 

###### 19 
Out of his mouth go flaming torches; sparks of fire leap forth. 

###### 20 
Out of his nostrils comes forth smoke, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes. 

###### 21 
His breath kindles coals, and a flame comes forth from his mouth. 

###### 22 
In his neck abides strength, and terror dances before him. 

###### 23 
The folds of his flesh stick together, firmly cast on him and immovable. 

###### 24 
His heart is hard as a stone, hard as the lower millstone. 

###### 25 
When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid; at the crashing they are beside themselves. 

###### 26 
Though the sword reaches him, it does not avail, nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin. 

###### 27 
He counts iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood. 

###### 28 
The arrow cannot make him flee; for him, sling stones are turned to stubble. 

###### 29 
Clubs are counted as stubble; he laughs at the rattle of javelins. 

###### 30 
His underparts are like sharp potsherds; he spreads himself like a threshing sledge on the mire. 

###### 31 
He makes the deep boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a pot of ointment. 

###### 32 
Behind him he leaves a shining wake; one would think the deep to be white-haired. 

###### 33 
On earth there is not his like, a creature without fear. 

###### 34 
He sees everything that is high; he is king over all the sons of pride."
