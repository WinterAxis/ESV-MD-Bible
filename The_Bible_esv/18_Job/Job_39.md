###### 1 
"Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you observe the calving of the does? 

###### 2 
Can you number the months that they fulfill, and do you know the time when they give birth, 

###### 3 
when they crouch, bring forth their offspring, and are delivered of their young? 

###### 4 
Their young ones become strong; they grow up in the open; they go out and do not return to them. 

###### 5 
"Who has let the wild donkey go free? Who has loosed the bonds of the swift donkey, 

###### 6 
to whom I have given the arid plain for his home and the salt land for his dwelling place? 

###### 7 
He scorns the tumult of the city; he hears not the shouts of the driver. 

###### 8 
He ranges the mountains as his pasture, and he searches after every green thing. 

###### 9 
"Is the wild ox willing to serve you? Will he spend the night at your manger? 

###### 10 
Can you bind him in the furrow with ropes, or will he harrow the valleys after you? 

###### 11 
Will you depend on him because his strength is great, and will you leave to him your labor? 

###### 12 
Do you have faith in him that he will return your grain and gather it to your threshing floor? 

###### 13 
"The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, but are they the pinions and plumage of love? 

###### 14 
For she leaves her eggs to the earth and lets them be warmed on the ground, 

###### 15 
forgetting that a foot may crush them and that the wild beast may trample them. 

###### 16 
She deals cruelly with her young, as if they were not hers; though her labor be in vain, yet she has no fear, 

###### 17 
because God has made her forget wisdom and given her no share in understanding. 

###### 18 
When she rouses herself to flee, she laughs at the horse and his rider. 

###### 19 
"Do you give the horse his might? Do you clothe his neck with a mane? 

###### 20 
Do you make him leap like the locust? His majestic snorting is terrifying. 

###### 21 
He paws in the valley and exults in his strength; he goes out to meet the weapons. 

###### 22 
He laughs at fear and is not dismayed; he does not turn back from the sword. 

###### 23 
Upon him rattle the quiver, the flashing spear, and the javelin. 

###### 24 
With fierceness and rage he swallows the ground; he cannot stand still at the sound of the trumpet. 

###### 25 
When the trumpet sounds, he says 'Aha!' He smells the battle from afar, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 

###### 26 
"Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars and spreads his wings toward the south? 

###### 27 
Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes his nest on high? 

###### 28 
On the rock he dwells and makes his home, on the rocky crag and stronghold. 

###### 29 
From there he spies out the prey; his eyes behold it from far away. 

###### 30 
His young ones suck up blood, and where the slain are, there is he." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
