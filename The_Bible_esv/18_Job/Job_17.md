###### 1 
"My spirit is broken; my days are extinct; the graveyard is ready for me. 

###### 2 
Surely there are mockers about me, and my eye dwells on their provocation. 

###### 3 
"Lay down a pledge for me with you; who is there who will put up security for me? 

###### 4 
Since you have closed their hearts to understanding, therefore you will not let them triumph. 

###### 5 
He who informs against his friends to get a share of their property-- the eyes of his children will fail. 

###### 6 
"He has made me a byword of the peoples, and I am one before whom men spit. 

###### 7 
My eye has grown dim from vexation, and all my members are like a shadow. 

###### 8 
The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent stirs himself up against the godless. 

###### 9 
Yet the righteous holds to his way, and he who has clean hands grows stronger and stronger. 

###### 10 
But you, come on again, all of you, and I shall not find a wise man among you. 

###### 11 
My days are past; my plans are broken off, the desires of my heart. 

###### 12 
They make night into day: 'The light,' they say, 'is near to the darkness.' 

###### 13 
If I hope for Sheol as my house, if I make my bed in darkness, 

###### 14 
if I say to the pit, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother,' or 'My sister,' 

###### 15 
where then is my hope? Who will see my hope? 

###### 16 
Will it go down to the bars of Sheol? Shall we descend together into the dust?"
