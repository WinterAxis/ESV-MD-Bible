###### 1 
"I loathe my life; I will give free utterance to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 

###### 2 
I will say to God, Do not condemn me; let me know why you contend against me. 

###### 3 
Does it seem good to you to oppress, to despise the work of your hands and favor the designs of the wicked? 

###### 4 
Have you eyes of flesh? Do you see as man sees? 

###### 5 
Are your days as the days of man, or your years as a man's years, 

###### 6 
that you seek out my iniquity and search for my sin, 

###### 7 
although you know that I am not guilty, and there is none to deliver out of your hand? 

###### 8 
Your hands fashioned and made me, and now you have destroyed me altogether. 

###### 9 
Remember that you have made me like clay; and will you return me to the dust? 

###### 10 
Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese? 

###### 11 
You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews. 

###### 12 
You have granted me life and steadfast love, and your care has preserved my spirit. 

###### 13 
Yet these things you hid in your heart; I know that this was your purpose. 

###### 14 
If I sin, you watch me and do not acquit me of my iniquity. 

###### 15 
If I am guilty, woe to me! If I am in the right, I cannot lift up my head, for I am filled with disgrace and look on my affliction. 

###### 16 
And were my head lifted up, you would hunt me like a lion and again work wonders against me. 

###### 17 
You renew your witnesses against me and increase your vexation toward me; you bring fresh troops against me. 

###### 18 
"Why did you bring me out from the womb? Would that I had died before any eye had seen me 

###### 19 
and were as though I had not been, carried from the womb to the grave. 

###### 20 
Are not my days few? Then cease, and leave me alone, that I may find a little cheer 

###### 21 
before I go--and I shall not return-- to the land of darkness and deep shadow, 

###### 22 
the land of gloom like thick darkness, like deep shadow without any order, where light is as thick darkness." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
