###### 1 
"Man who is born of a woman is few of days and full of trouble. 

###### 2 
He comes out like a flower and withers; he flees like a shadow and continues not. 

###### 3 
And do you open your eyes on such a one and bring me into judgment with you? 

###### 4 
Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? There is not one. 

###### 5 
Since his days are determined, and the number of his months is with you, and you have appointed his limits that he cannot pass, 

###### 6 
look away from him and leave him alone, that he may enjoy, like a hired hand, his day. 

###### 7 
"For there is hope for a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its shoots will not cease. 

###### 8 
Though its root grow old in the earth, and its stump die in the soil, 

###### 9 
yet at the scent of water it will bud and put out branches like a young plant. 

###### 10 
But a man dies and is laid low; man breathes his last, and where is he? 

###### 11 
As waters fail from a lake and a river wastes away and dries up, 

###### 12 
so a man lies down and rises not again; till the heavens are no more he will not awake or be roused out of his sleep. 

###### 13 
Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would conceal me until your wrath be past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me! 

###### 14 
If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my service I would wait, till my renewal should come. 

###### 15 
You would call, and I would answer you; you would long for the work of your hands. 

###### 16 
For then you would number my steps; you would not keep watch over my sin; 

###### 17 
my transgression would be sealed up in a bag, and you would cover over my iniquity. 

###### 18 
"But the mountain falls and crumbles away, and the rock is removed from its place; 

###### 19 
the waters wear away the stones; the torrents wash away the soil of the earth; so you destroy the hope of man. 

###### 20 
You prevail forever against him, and he passes; you change his countenance, and send him away. 

###### 21 
His sons come to honor, and he does not know it; they are brought low, and he perceives it not. 

###### 22 
He feels only the pain of his own body, and he mourns only for himself." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
