###### 1 
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said: 

###### 2 
"Should a multitude of words go unanswered, and a man full of talk be judged right? 

###### 3 
Should your babble silence men, and when you mock, shall no one shame you? 

###### 4 
For you say, 'My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in God's eyes.' 

###### 5 
But oh, that God would speak and open his lips to you, 

###### 6 
and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves. 

###### 7 
"Can you find out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limit of the Almighty? 

###### 8 
It is higher than heaven--what can you do? Deeper than Sheol--what can you know? 

###### 9 
Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea. 

###### 10 
If he passes through and imprisons and summons the court, who can turn him back? 

###### 11 
For he knows worthless men; when he sees iniquity, will he not consider it? 

###### 12 
But a stupid man will get understanding when a wild donkey's colt is born a man! 

###### 13 
"If you prepare your heart, you will stretch out your hands toward him. 

###### 14 
If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and let not injustice dwell in your tents. 

###### 15 
Surely then you will lift up your face without blemish; you will be secure and will not fear. 

###### 16 
You will forget your misery; you will remember it as waters that have passed away. 

###### 17 
And your life will be brighter than the noonday; its darkness will be like the morning. 

###### 18 
And you will feel secure, because there is hope; you will look around and take your rest in security. 

###### 19 
You will lie down, and none will make you afraid; many will court your favor. 

###### 20 
But the eyes of the wicked will fail; all way of escape will be lost to them, and their hope is to breathe their last."
