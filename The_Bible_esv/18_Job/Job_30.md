###### 1 
"But now they laugh at me, men who are younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock. 

###### 2 
What could I gain from the strength of their hands, men whose vigor is gone? 

###### 3 
Through want and hard hunger they gnaw the dry ground by night in waste and desolation; 

###### 4 
they pick saltwort and the leaves of bushes, and the roots of the broom tree for their food. 

###### 5 
They are driven out from human company; they shout after them as after a thief. 

###### 6 
In the gullies of the torrents they must dwell, in holes of the earth and of the rocks. 

###### 7 
Among the bushes they bray; under the nettles they huddle together. 

###### 8 
A senseless, a nameless brood, they have been whipped out of the land. 

###### 9 
"And now I have become their song; I am a byword to them. 

###### 10 
They abhor me; they keep aloof from me; they do not hesitate to spit at the sight of me. 

###### 11 
Because God has loosed my cord and humbled me, they have cast off restraint in my presence. 

###### 12 
On my right hand the rabble rise; they push away my feet; they cast up against me their ways of destruction. 

###### 13 
They break up my path; they promote my calamity; they need no one to help them. 

###### 14 
As through a wide breach they come; amid the crash they roll on. 

###### 15 
Terrors are turned upon me; my honor is pursued as by the wind, and my prosperity has passed away like a cloud. 

###### 16 
"And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction have taken hold of me. 

###### 17 
The night racks my bones, and the pain that gnaws me takes no rest. 

###### 18 
With great force my garment is disfigured; it binds me about like the collar of my tunic. 

###### 19 
God has cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes. 

###### 20 
I cry to you for help and you do not answer me; I stand, and you only look at me. 

###### 21 
You have turned cruel to me; with the might of your hand you persecute me. 

###### 22 
You lift me up on the wind; you make me ride on it, and you toss me about in the roar of the storm. 

###### 23 
For I know that you will bring me to death and to the house appointed for all living. 

###### 24 
"Yet does not one in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand, and in his disaster cry for help? 

###### 25 
Did not I weep for him whose day was hard? Was not my soul grieved for the needy? 

###### 26 
But when I hoped for good, evil came, and when I waited for light, darkness came. 

###### 27 
My inward parts are in turmoil and never still; days of affliction come to meet me. 

###### 28 
I go about darkened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help. 

###### 29 
I am a brother of jackals and a companion of ostriches. 

###### 30 
My skin turns black and falls from me, and my bones burn with heat. 

###### 31 
My lyre is turned to mourning, and my pipe to the voice of those who weep. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
