###### 1 
Then Job answered and said: 

###### 2 
"Oh that my vexation were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances! 

###### 3 
For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash. 

###### 4 
For the arrows of the Almighty are in me; my spirit drinks their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me. 

###### 5 
Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass, or the ox low over his fodder? 

###### 6 
Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, or is there any taste in the juice of the mallow? 

###### 7 
My appetite refuses to touch them; they are as food that is loathsome to me. 

###### 8 
"Oh that I might have my request, and that God would fulfill my hope, 

###### 9 
that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off! 

###### 10 
This would be my comfort; I would even exult in pain unsparing, for I have not denied the words of the Holy One. 

###### 11 
What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient? 

###### 12 
Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze? 

###### 13 
Have I any help in me, when resource is driven from me? 

###### 14 
"He who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty. 

###### 15 
My brothers are treacherous as a torrent-bed, as torrential streams that pass away, 

###### 16 
which are dark with ice, and where the snow hides itself. 

###### 17 
When they melt, they disappear; when it is hot, they vanish from their place. 

###### 18 
The caravans turn aside from their course; they go up into the waste and perish. 

###### 19 
The caravans of Tema look, the travelers of Sheba hope. 

###### 20 
They are ashamed because they were confident; they come there and are disappointed. 

###### 21 
For you have now become nothing; you see my calamity and are afraid. 

###### 22 
Have I said, 'Make me a gift'? Or, 'From your wealth offer a bribe for me'? 

###### 23 
Or, 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand'? Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the ruthless'? 

###### 24 
"Teach me, and I will be silent; make me understand how I have gone astray. 

###### 25 
How forceful are upright words! But what does reproof from you reprove? 

###### 26 
Do you think that you can reprove words, when the speech of a despairing man is wind? 

###### 27 
You would even cast lots over the fatherless, and bargain over your friend. 

###### 28 
"But now, be pleased to look at me, for I will not lie to your face. 

###### 29 
Please turn; let no injustice be done. Turn now; my vindication is at stake. 

###### 30 
Is there any injustice on my tongue? Cannot my palate discern the cause of calamity? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
