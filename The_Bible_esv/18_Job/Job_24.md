###### 1 
"Why are not times of judgment kept by the Almighty, and why do those who know him never see his days? 

###### 2 
Some move landmarks; they seize flocks and pasture them. 

###### 3 
They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; they take the widow's ox for a pledge. 

###### 4 
They thrust the poor off the road; the poor of the earth all hide themselves. 

###### 5 
Behold, like wild donkeys in the desert the poor go out to their toil, seeking game; the wasteland yields food for their children. 

###### 6 
They gather their fodder in the field, and they glean the vineyard of the wicked man. 

###### 7 
They lie all night naked, without clothing, and have no covering in the cold. 

###### 8 
They are wet with the rain of the mountains and cling to the rock for lack of shelter. 

###### 9 
(There are those who snatch the fatherless child from the breast, and they take a pledge against the poor.) 

###### 10 
They go about naked, without clothing; hungry, they carry the sheaves; 

###### 11 
among the olive rows of the wicked they make oil; they tread the winepresses, but suffer thirst. 

###### 12 
From out of the city the dying groan, and the soul of the wounded cries for help; yet God charges no one with wrong. 

###### 13 
"There are those who rebel against the light, who are not acquainted with its ways, and do not stay in its paths. 

###### 14 
The murderer rises before it is light, that he may kill the poor and needy, and in the night he is like a thief. 

###### 15 
The eye of the adulterer also waits for the twilight, saying, 'No eye will see me'; and he veils his face. 

###### 16 
In the dark they dig through houses; by day they shut themselves up; they do not know the light. 

###### 17 
For deep darkness is morning to all of them; for they are friends with the terrors of deep darkness. 

###### 18 
"You say, 'Swift are they on the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the land; no treader turns toward their vineyards. 

###### 19 
Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters; so does Sheol those who have sinned. 

###### 20 
The womb forgets them; the worm finds them sweet; they are no longer remembered, so wickedness is broken like a tree.' 

###### 21 
"They wrong the barren, childless woman, and do no good to the widow. 

###### 22 
Yet God prolongs the life of the mighty by his power; they rise up when they despair of life. 

###### 23 
He gives them security, and they are supported, and his eyes are upon their ways. 

###### 24 
They are exalted a little while, and then are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like the heads of grain. 

###### 25 
If it is not so, who will prove me a liar and show that there is nothing in what I say?"
