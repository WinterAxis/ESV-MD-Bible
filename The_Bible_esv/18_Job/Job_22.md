###### 1 
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: 

###### 2 
"Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself. 

###### 3 
Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are in the right, or is it gain to him if you make your ways blameless? 

###### 4 
Is it for your fear of him that he reproves you and enters into judgment with you? 

###### 5 
Is not your evil abundant? There is no end to your iniquities. 

###### 6 
For you have exacted pledges of your brothers for nothing and stripped the naked of their clothing. 

###### 7 
You have given no water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry. 

###### 8 
The man with power possessed the land, and the favored man lived in it. 

###### 9 
You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless were crushed. 

###### 10 
Therefore snares are all around you, and sudden terror overwhelms you, 

###### 11 
or darkness, so that you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you. 

###### 12 
"Is not God high in the heavens? See the highest stars, how lofty they are! 

###### 13 
But you say, 'What does God know? Can he judge through the deep darkness? 

###### 14 
Thick clouds veil him, so that he does not see, and he walks on the vault of heaven.' 

###### 15 
Will you keep to the old way that wicked men have trod? 

###### 16 
They were snatched away before their time; their foundation was washed away. 

###### 17 
They said to God, 'Depart from us,' and 'What can the Almighty do to us?' 

###### 18 
Yet he filled their houses with good things-- but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

###### 19 
The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent one mocks at them, 

###### 20 
saying, 'Surely our adversaries are cut off, and what they left the fire has consumed.' 

###### 21 
"Agree with God, and be at peace; thereby good will come to you. 

###### 22 
Receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart. 

###### 23 
If you return to the Almighty you will be built up; if you remove injustice far from your tents, 

###### 24 
if you lay gold in the dust, and gold of Ophir among the stones of the torrent-bed, 

###### 25 
then the Almighty will be your gold and your precious silver. 

###### 26 
For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty and lift up your face to God. 

###### 27 
You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you, and you will pay your vows. 

###### 28 
You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways. 

###### 29 
For when they are humbled you say, 'It is because of pride'; but he saves the lowly. 

###### 30 
He delivers even the one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."
