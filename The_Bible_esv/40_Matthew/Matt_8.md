###### 1 
When he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him. 

###### 2 
And behold, a leper came to him and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, if you will, you can make me clean." 

###### 3 
And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, **"I will; be clean."** And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 

###### 4 
And Jesus said to him, **"See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them."** ## The Faith of a Centurion 

###### 5 
When he had entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, appealing to him, 

###### 6 
"Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering terribly." 

###### 7 
And he said to him, **"I will come and heal him."** 

###### 8 
But the centurion replied, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. 

###### 9 
For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it." 

###### 10 
When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, **"Truly, I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith.** 

###### 11 
I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, 

###### 12 
while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." 

###### 13 
And to the centurion Jesus said, **"Go; let it be done for you as you have believed."** And the servant was healed at that very moment. ## Jesus Heals Many 

###### 14 
And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever. 

###### 15 
He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and began to serve him. 

###### 16 
That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick. 

###### 17 
This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: "He took our illnesses and bore our diseases." ## The Cost of Following Jesus 

###### 18 
Now when Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side. 

###### 19 
And a scribe came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go." 

###### 20 
And Jesus said to him, **"Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."** 

###### 21 
Another of the disciples said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father." 

###### 22 
And Jesus said to him, **"Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead."** ## Jesus Calms a Storm 

###### 23 
And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him. 

###### 24 
And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep. 

###### 25 
And they went and woke him, saying, "Save us, Lord; we are perishing." 

###### 26 
And he said to them, **"Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?"** Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. 

###### 27 
And the men marveled, saying, "What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?" ## Jesus Heals Two Men with Demons 

###### 28 
And when he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one could pass that way. 

###### 29 
And behold, they cried out, "What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?" 

###### 30 
Now a herd of many pigs was feeding at some distance from them. 

###### 31 
And the demons begged him, saying, "If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of pigs." 

###### 32 
And he said to them, **"Go."** So they came out and went into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters. 

###### 33 
The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men. 

###### 34 
And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
