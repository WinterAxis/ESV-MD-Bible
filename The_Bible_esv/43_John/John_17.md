###### 1 
When Jesus had spoken these words, he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, **"Father, the hour has come; glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you,** 

###### 2 
since you have given him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom you have given him. 

###### 3 
And this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. 

###### 4 
I glorified you on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do. 

###### 5 
And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory that I had with you before the world existed. 

###### 6 
"I have manifested your name to the people whom you gave me out of the world. Yours they were, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. 

###### 7 
Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you. 

###### 8 
For I have given them the words that you gave me, and they have received them and have come to know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me. 

###### 9 
I am praying for them. I am not praying for the world but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours. 

###### 10 
All mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them. 

###### 11 
And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name, which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are one. 

###### 12 
While I was with them, I kept them in your name, which you have given me. I have guarded them, and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. 

###### 13 
But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves. 

###### 14 
I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. 

###### 15 
I do not ask that you take them out of the world, but that you keep them from the evil one. 

###### 16 
They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. 

###### 17 
Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. 

###### 18 
As you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world. 

###### 19 
And for their sake I consecrate myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth. 

###### 20 
"I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word, 

###### 21 
that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me. 

###### 22 
The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, 

###### 23 
I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me. 

###### 24 
Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world. 

###### 25 
O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me. 

###### 26 
I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them."
