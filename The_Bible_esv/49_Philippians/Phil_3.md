###### 1 


Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you. 





###### 2 


Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh. 





###### 3 


For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh-- 





###### 4 


though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: 





###### 5 


circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; 





###### 6 


as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless. 





###### 7 


But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. 





###### 8 


Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ 





###### 9 


and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith-- 





###### 10 


that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, 





###### 11 


that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead. ## Straining Toward the Goal 





###### 12 


Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. 





###### 13 


Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, 





###### 14 


I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 





###### 15 


Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you. 





###### 16 


Only let us hold true to what we have attained. 





###### 17 


Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us. 





###### 18 


For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ. 





###### 19 


Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things. 





###### 20 


But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, 





###### 21 


who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
