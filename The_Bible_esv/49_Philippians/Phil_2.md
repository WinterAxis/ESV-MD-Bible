###### 1 

So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, 

###### 2 

complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. 

###### 3 

Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. 

###### 4 

Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. 

###### 5 

Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, 

###### 6 

who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, 

###### 7 

but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. 

###### 8 

And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. 

###### 9 

Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, 

###### 10 

so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 

###### 11 

and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. ## Lights in the World 

###### 12 

Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, 

###### 13 

for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. 

###### 14 

Do all things without grumbling or disputing, 

###### 15 

that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, 

###### 16 

holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. 

###### 17 

Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. 

###### 18 

Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me. ## Timothy and Epaphroditus 

###### 19 

I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you. 

###### 20 

For I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare. 

###### 21 

For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. 

###### 22 

But you know Timothy's proven worth, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel. 

###### 23 

I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me, 

###### 24 

and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also. 

###### 25 

I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need, 

###### 26 

for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill. 

###### 27 

Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 

###### 28 

I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious. 

###### 29 

So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men, 

###### 30 

for he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.
