###### 1 

Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek him with you? ## Together in the Garden of Love 

###### 2 

My beloved has gone down to his garden to the beds of spices, to graze in the gardens and to gather lilies. 

###### 3 

I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine; he grazes among the lilies. ## Solomon and His Bride Delight in Each Other 

###### 4 

You are beautiful as Tirzah, my love, lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners. 

###### 5 

Turn away your eyes from me, for they overwhelm me-- Your hair is like a flock of goats leaping down the slopes of Gilead. 

###### 6 

Your teeth are like a flock of ewes that have come up from the washing; all of them bear twins; not one among them has lost its young. 

###### 7 

Your cheeks are like halves of a pomegranate behind your veil. 

###### 8 

There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and virgins without number. 

###### 9 

My dove, my perfect one, is the only one, the only one of her mother, pure to her who bore her. The young women saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines also, and they praised her. 

###### 10 

"Who is this who looks down like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, bright as the sun, awesome as an army with banners?" 

###### 11 

I went down to the nut orchard to look at the blossoms of the valley, to see whether the vines had budded, whether the pomegranates were in bloom. 

###### 12 

Before I was aware, my desire set me among the chariots of my kinsman, a prince. 

###### 13 

Return, return, O Shulammite, return, return, that we may look upon you. Why should you look upon the Shulammite, as upon a dance before two armies?
