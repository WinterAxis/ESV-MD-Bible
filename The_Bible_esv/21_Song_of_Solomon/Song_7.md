###### 1 

How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O noble daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand. 

###### 2 

Your navel is a rounded bowl that never lacks mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat, encircled with lilies. 

###### 3 

Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle. 

###### 4 

Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim. Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon, which looks toward Damascus. 

###### 5 

Your head crowns you like Carmel, and your flowing locks are like purple; a king is held captive in the tresses. 

###### 6 

How beautiful and pleasant you are, O loved one, with all your delights! 

###### 7 

Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters. 

###### 8 

I say I will climb the palm tree and lay hold of its fruit. Oh may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the scent of your breath like apples, 

###### 9 

and your mouth like the best wine. It goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding over lips and teeth. 

###### 10 

I am my beloved's, and his desire is for me. ## The Bride Gives Her Love 

###### 11 

Come, my beloved, let us go out into the fields and lodge in the villages; 

###### 12 

let us go out early to the vineyards and see whether the vines have budded, whether the grape blossoms have opened and the pomegranates are in bloom. There I will give you my love. 

###### 13 

The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and beside our doors are all choice fruits, new as well as old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.
