###### 1 

Oh that you were like a brother to me who nursed at my mother's breasts! If I found you outside, I would kiss you, and none would despise me. 

###### 2 

I would lead you and bring you into the house of my mother-- she who used to teach me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the juice of my pomegranate. 

###### 3 

His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me! 

###### 4 

I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases. 

###### 5 

Who is that coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother was in labor with you; there she who bore you was in labor. 

###### 6 

Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is strong as death, jealousy is fierce as the grave. Its flashes are flashes of fire, the very flame of the LORD. 

###### 7 

Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it. If a man offered for love all the wealth of his house, he would be utterly despised. ## Final Advice 

###### 8 

We have a little sister, and she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day when she is spoken for? 

###### 9 

If she is a wall, we will build on her a battlement of silver, but if she is a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar. 

###### 10 

I was a wall, and my breasts were like towers; then I was in his eyes as one who finds peace. 

###### 11 

Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; each one was to bring for its fruit a thousand pieces of silver. 

###### 12 

My vineyard, my very own, is before me; you, O Solomon, may have the thousand, and the keepers of the fruit two hundred. 

###### 13 

O you who dwell in the gardens, with companions listening for your voice; let me hear it. 

###### 14 

Make haste, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.
