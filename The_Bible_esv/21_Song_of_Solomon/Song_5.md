###### 1 


I came to my garden, my sister, my bride, I gathered my myrrh with my spice, I ate my honeycomb with my honey, I drank my wine with my milk. Eat, friends, drink, and be drunk with love! ## The Bride Searches for Her Beloved 





###### 2 


I slept, but my heart was awake. A sound! My beloved is knocking. "Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one, for my head is wet with dew, my locks with the drops of the night." 





###### 3 


I had put off my garment; how could I put it on? I had bathed my feet; how could I soil them? 





###### 4 


My beloved put his hand to the latch, and my heart was thrilled within me. 





###### 5 


I arose to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the bolt. 





###### 6 


I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had turned and gone. My soul failed me when he spoke. I sought him, but found him not; I called him, but he gave no answer. 





###### 7 


The watchmen found me as they went about in the city; they beat me, they bruised me, they took away my veil, those watchmen of the walls. 





###### 8 


I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him I am sick with love. 





###### 9 


What is your beloved more than another beloved, O most beautiful among women? What is your beloved more than another beloved, that you thus adjure us? ## The Bride Praises Her Beloved 





###### 10 


My beloved is radiant and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand. 





###### 11 


His head is the finest gold; his locks are wavy, black as a raven. 





###### 12 


His eyes are like doves beside streams of water, bathed in milk, sitting beside a full pool. 





###### 13 


His cheeks are like beds of spices, mounds of sweet-smelling herbs. His lips are lilies, dripping liquid myrrh. 





###### 14 


His arms are rods of gold, set with jewels. His body is polished ivory, bedecked with sapphires. 





###### 15 


His legs are alabaster columns, set on bases of gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as the cedars. 





###### 16 


His mouth is most sweet, and he is altogether desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
