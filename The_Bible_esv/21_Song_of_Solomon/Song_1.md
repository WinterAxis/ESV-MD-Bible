###### 1 

The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's. ## The Bride Confesses Her Love 

###### 2 

Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! For your love is better than wine; 

###### 3 

your anointing oils are fragrant; your name is oil poured out; therefore virgins love you. 

###### 4 

Draw me after you; let us run. The king has brought me into his chambers. We will exult and rejoice in you; we will extol your love more than wine; rightly do they love you. 

###### 5 

I am very dark, but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. 

###### 6 

Do not gaze at me because I am dark, because the sun has looked upon me. My mother's sons were angry with me; they made me keeper of the vineyards, but my own vineyard I have not kept! 

###### 7 

Tell me, you whom my soul loves, where you pasture your flock, where you make it lie down at noon; for why should I be like one who veils herself beside the flocks of your companions? ## Solomon and His Bride Delight in Each Other 

###### 8 

If you do not know, O most beautiful among women, follow in the tracks of the flock, and pasture your young goats beside the shepherds' tents. 

###### 9 

I compare you, my love, to a mare among Pharaoh's chariots. 

###### 10 

Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels. 

###### 11 

We will make for you ornaments of gold, studded with silver. 

###### 12 

While the king was on his couch, my nard gave forth its fragrance. 

###### 13 

My beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh that lies between my breasts. 

###### 14 

My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of Engedi. 

###### 15 

Behold, you are beautiful, my love; behold, you are beautiful; your eyes are doves. 

###### 16 

Behold, you are beautiful, my beloved, truly delightful. Our couch is green; 

###### 17 

the beams of our house are cedar; our rafters are pine.
