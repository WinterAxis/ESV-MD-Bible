###### 1 
The oracle concerning the valley of vision. What do you mean that you have gone up, all of you, to the housetops, 

###### 2 
you who are full of shoutings, tumultuous city, exultant town? Your slain are not slain with the sword or dead in battle. 

###### 3 
All your leaders have fled together; without the bow they were captured. All of you who were found were captured, though they had fled far away. 

###### 4 
Therefore I said: "Look away from me; let me weep bitter tears; do not labor to comfort me concerning the destruction of the daughter of my people." 

###### 5 
For the Lord God of hosts has a day of tumult and trampling and confusion in the valley of vision, a battering down of walls and a shouting to the mountains. 

###### 6 
And Elam bore the quiver with chariots and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield. 

###### 7 
Your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen took their stand at the gates. 

###### 8 
He has taken away the covering of Judah. In that day you looked to the weapons of the House of the Forest, 

###### 9 
and you saw that the breaches of the city of David were many. You collected the waters of the lower pool, 

###### 10 
and you counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall. 

###### 11 
You made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you did not look to him who did it, or see him who planned it long ago. 

###### 12 
In that day the Lord God of hosts called for weeping and mourning, for baldness and wearing sackcloth; 

###### 13 
and behold, joy and gladness, killing oxen and slaughtering sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine. "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." 

###### 14 
The LORD of hosts has revealed himself in my ears: "Surely this iniquity will not be atoned for you until you die," says the Lord God of hosts. 

###### 15 
Thus says the Lord God of hosts, "Come, go to this steward, to Shebna, who is over the household, and say to him: 

###### 16 
What have you to do here, and whom have you here, that you have cut out here a tomb for yourself, you who cut out a tomb on the height and carve a dwelling for yourself in the rock? 

###### 17 
Behold, the LORD will hurl you away violently, O you strong man. He will seize firm hold on you 

###### 18 
and whirl you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a wide land. There you shall die, and there shall be your glorious chariots, you shame of your master's house. 

###### 19 
I will thrust you from your office, and you will be pulled down from your station. 

###### 20 
In that day I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, 

###### 21 
and I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your sash on him, and will commit your authority to his hand. And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. 

###### 22 
And I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David. He shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. 

###### 23 
And I will fasten him like a peg in a secure place, and he will become a throne of honor to his father's house. 

###### 24 
And they will hang on him the whole honor of his father's house, the offspring and issue, every small vessel, from the cups to all the flagons. 

###### 25 
In that day, declares the LORD of hosts, the peg that was fastened in a secure place will give way, and it will be cut down and fall, and the load that was on it will be cut off, for the LORD has spoken."
