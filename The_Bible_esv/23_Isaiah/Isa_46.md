###### 1 
Bel bows down; Nebo stoops; their idols are on beasts and livestock; these things you carry are borne as burdens on weary beasts. 

###### 2 
They stoop; they bow down together; they cannot save the burden, but themselves go into captivity. 

###### 3 
"Listen to me, O house of Jacob, all the remnant of the house of Israel, who have been borne by me from before your birth, carried from the womb; 

###### 4 
even to your old age I am he, and to gray hairs I will carry you. I have made, and I will bear; I will carry and will save. 

###### 5 
"To whom will you liken me and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be alike? 

###### 6 
Those who lavish gold from the purse, and weigh out silver in the scales, hire a goldsmith, and he makes it into a god; then they fall down and worship! 

###### 7 
They lift it to their shoulders, they carry it, they set it in its place, and it stands there; it cannot move from its place. If one cries to it, it does not answer or save him from his trouble. 

###### 8 
"Remember this and stand firm, recall it to mind, you transgressors, 

###### 9 
remember the former things of old; for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me, 

###### 10 
declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things not yet done, saying, 'My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose,' 

###### 11 
calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country. I have spoken, and I will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it. 

###### 12 
"Listen to me, you stubborn of heart, you who are far from righteousness: 

###### 13 
I bring near my righteousness; it is not far off, and my salvation will not delay; I will put salvation in Zion, for Israel my glory." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
