###### 1 
In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. 

###### 2 
Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 

###### 3 
And one called to another and said: "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!" 

###### 4 
And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. 

###### 5 
And I said: "Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!" 

###### 6 
Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. 

###### 7 
And he touched my mouth and said: "Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for." ## Isaiah's Commission from the Lord 

###### 8 
And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" Then I said, "Here I am! Send me." 

###### 9 
And he said, "Go, and say to this people: "'Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.' 

###### 10 
Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed." 

###### 11 
Then I said, "How long, O Lord?" And he said: "Until cities lie waste without inhabitant, and houses without people, and the land is a desolate waste, 

###### 12 
and the LORD removes people far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land. 

###### 13 
And though a tenth remain in it, it will be burned again, like a terebinth or an oak, whose stump remains when it is felled." The holy seed is its stump. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
