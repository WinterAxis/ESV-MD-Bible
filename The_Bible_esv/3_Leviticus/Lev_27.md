###### 1 
The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
"Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, If anyone makes a special vow to the LORD involving the valuation of persons, 

###### 3 
then the valuation of a male from twenty years old up to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary. 

###### 4 
If the person is a female, the valuation shall be thirty shekels. 

###### 5 
If the person is from five years old up to twenty years old, the valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels, and for a female ten shekels. 

###### 6 
If the person is from a month old up to five years old, the valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver, and for a female the valuation shall be three shekels of silver. 

###### 7 
And if the person is sixty years old or over, then the valuation for a male shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female ten shekels. 

###### 8 
And if someone is too poor to pay the valuation, then he shall be made to stand before the priest, and the priest shall value him; the priest shall value him according to what the vower can afford. 

###### 9 
"If the vow is an animal that may be offered as an offering to the LORD, all of it that he gives to the LORD is holy. 

###### 10 
He shall not exchange it or make a substitute for it, good for bad, or bad for good; and if he does in fact substitute one animal for another, then both it and the substitute shall be holy. 

###### 11 
And if it is any unclean animal that may not be offered as an offering to the LORD, then he shall stand the animal before the priest, 

###### 12 
and the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall be. 

###### 13 
But if he wishes to redeem it, he shall add a fifth to the valuation. 

###### 14 
"When a man dedicates his house as a holy gift to the LORD, the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand. 

###### 15 
And if the donor wishes to redeem his house, he shall add a fifth to the valuation price, and it shall be his. 

###### 16 
"If a man dedicates to the LORD part of the land that is his possession, then the valuation shall be in proportion to its seed. A homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. 

###### 17 
If he dedicates his field from the year of jubilee, the valuation shall stand, 

###### 18 
but if he dedicates his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall calculate the price according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee, and a deduction shall be made from the valuation. 

###### 19 
And if he who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, then he shall add a fifth to its valuation price, and it shall remain his. 

###### 20 
But if he does not wish to redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore. 

###### 21 
But the field, when it is released in the jubilee, shall be a holy gift to the LORD, like a field that has been devoted. The priest shall be in possession of it. 

###### 22 
If he dedicates to the LORD a field that he has bought, which is not a part of his possession, 

###### 23 
then the priest shall calculate the amount of the valuation for it up to the year of jubilee, and the man shall give the valuation on that day as a holy gift to the LORD. 

###### 24 
In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, to whom the land belongs as a possession. 

###### 25 
Every valuation shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall make a shekel. 

###### 26 
"But a firstborn of animals, which as a firstborn belongs to the LORD, no man may dedicate; whether ox or sheep, it is the LORD's. 

###### 27 
And if it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back at the valuation, and add a fifth to it; or, if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold at the valuation. 

###### 28 
"But no devoted thing that a man devotes to the LORD, of anything that he has, whether man or beast, or of his inherited field, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD. 

###### 29 
No one devoted, who is to be devoted for destruction from mankind, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death. 

###### 30 
"Every tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees, is the LORD's; it is holy to the LORD. 

###### 31 
If a man wishes to redeem some of his tithe, he shall add a fifth to it. 

###### 32 
And every tithe of herds and flocks, every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman's staff, shall be holy to the LORD. 

###### 33 
One shall not differentiate between good or bad, neither shall he make a substitute for it; and if he does substitute for it, then both it and the substitute shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed." 

###### 34 
These are the commandments that the LORD commanded Moses for the people of Israel on Mount Sinai. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
