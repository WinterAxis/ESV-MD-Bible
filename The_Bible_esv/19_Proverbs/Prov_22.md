###### 1 

A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, and favor is better than silver or gold. 

###### 2 

The rich and the poor meet together; the LORD is the Maker of them all. 

###### 3 

The prudent sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it. 

###### 4 

The reward for humility and fear of the LORD is riches and honor and life. 

###### 5 

Thorns and snares are in the way of the crooked; whoever guards his soul will keep far from them. 

###### 6 

Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it. 

###### 7 

The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is the slave of the lender. 

###### 8 

Whoever sows injustice will reap calamity, and the rod of his fury will fail. 

###### 9 

Whoever has a bountiful eye will be blessed, for he shares his bread with the poor. 

###### 10 

Drive out a scoffer, and strife will go out, and quarreling and abuse will cease. 

###### 11 

He who loves purity of heart, and whose speech is gracious, will have the king as his friend. 

###### 12 

The eyes of the LORD keep watch over knowledge, but he overthrows the words of the traitor. 

###### 13 

The sluggard says, "There is a lion outside! I shall be killed in the streets!" 

###### 14 

The mouth of forbidden women is a deep pit; he with whom the LORD is angry will fall into it. 

###### 15 

Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline drives it far from him. 

###### 16 

Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth, or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty. ## Words of the Wise 

###### 17 

Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply your heart to my knowledge, 

###### 18 

for it will be pleasant if you keep them within you, if all of them are ready on your lips. 

###### 19 

That your trust may be in the LORD, I have made them known to you today, even to you. 

###### 20 

Have I not written for you thirty sayings of counsel and knowledge, 

###### 21 

to make you know what is right and true, that you may give a true answer to those who sent you? 

###### 22 

Do not rob the poor, because he is poor, or crush the afflicted at the gate, 

###### 23 

for the LORD will plead their cause and rob of life those who rob them. 

###### 24 

Make no friendship with a man given to anger, nor go with a wrathful man, 

###### 25 

lest you learn his ways and entangle yourself in a snare. 

###### 26 

Be not one of those who give pledges, who put up security for debts. 

###### 27 

If you have nothing with which to pay, why should your bed be taken from under you? 

###### 28 

Do not move the ancient landmark that your fathers have set. 

###### 29 

Do you see a man skillful in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men.
