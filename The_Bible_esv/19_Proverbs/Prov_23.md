###### 1 


When you sit down to eat with a ruler, observe carefully what is before you, 





###### 2 


and put a knife to your throat if you are given to appetite. 





###### 3 


Do not desire his delicacies, for they are deceptive food. 





###### 4 


Do not toil to acquire wealth; be discerning enough to desist. 





###### 5 


When your eyes light on it, it is gone, for suddenly it sprouts wings, flying like an eagle toward heaven. 





###### 6 


Do not eat the bread of a man who is stingy; do not desire his delicacies, 





###### 7 


for he is like one who is inwardly calculating. "Eat and drink!" he says to you, but his heart is not with you. 





###### 8 


You will vomit up the morsels that you have eaten, and waste your pleasant words. 





###### 9 


Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, for he will despise the good sense of your words. 





###### 10 


Do not move an ancient landmark or enter the fields of the fatherless, 





###### 11 


for their Redeemer is strong; he will plead their cause against you. 





###### 12 


Apply your heart to instruction and your ear to words of knowledge. 





###### 13 


Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you strike him with a rod, he will not die. 





###### 14 


If you strike him with the rod, you will save his soul from Sheol. 





###### 15 


My son, if your heart is wise, my heart too will be glad. 





###### 16 


My inmost being will exult when your lips speak what is right. 





###### 17 


Let not your heart envy sinners, but continue in the fear of the LORD all the day. 





###### 18 


Surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off. 





###### 19 


Hear, my son, and be wise, and direct your heart in the way. 





###### 20 


Be not among drunkards or among gluttonous eaters of meat, 





###### 21 


for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and slumber will clothe them with rags. 





###### 22 


Listen to your father who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old. 





###### 23 


Buy truth, and do not sell it; buy wisdom, instruction, and understanding. 





###### 24 


The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; he who fathers a wise son will be glad in him. 





###### 25 


Let your father and mother be glad; let her who bore you rejoice. 





###### 26 


My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways. 





###### 27 


For a prostitute is a deep pit; an adulteress is a narrow well. 





###### 28 


She lies in wait like a robber and increases the traitors among mankind. 





###### 29 


Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes? 





###### 30 


Those who tarry long over wine; those who go to try mixed wine. 





###### 31 


Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly. 





###### 32 


In the end it bites like a serpent and stings like an adder. 





###### 33 


Your eyes will see strange things, and your heart utter perverse things. 





###### 34 


You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea, like one who lies on the top of a mast. 





###### 35 


"They struck me," you will say, "but I was not hurt; they beat me, but I did not feel it. When shall I awake? I must have another drink." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
