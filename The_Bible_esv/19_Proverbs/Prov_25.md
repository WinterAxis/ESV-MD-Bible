###### 1 


These also are proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied. 





###### 2 


It is the glory of God to conceal things, but the glory of kings is to search things out. 





###### 3 


As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, so the heart of kings is unsearchable. 





###### 4 


Take away the dross from the silver, and the smith has material for a vessel; 





###### 5 


take away the wicked from the presence of the king, and his throne will be established in righteousness. 





###### 6 


Do not put yourself forward in the king's presence or stand in the place of the great, 





###### 7 


for it is better to be told, "Come up here," than to be put lower in the presence of a noble. What your eyes have seen 





###### 8 


do not hastily bring into court, for what will you do in the end, when your neighbor puts you to shame? 





###### 9 


Argue your case with your neighbor himself, and do not reveal another's secret, 





###### 10 


lest he who hears you bring shame upon you, and your ill repute have no end. 





###### 11 


A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in a setting of silver. 





###### 12 


Like a gold ring or an ornament of gold is a wise reprover to a listening ear. 





###### 13 


Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest is a faithful messenger to those who send him; he refreshes the soul of his masters. 





###### 14 


Like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts of a gift he does not give. 





###### 15 


With patience a ruler may be persuaded, and a soft tongue will break a bone. 





###### 16 


If you have found honey, eat only enough for you, lest you have your fill of it and vomit it. 





###### 17 


Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house, lest he have his fill of you and hate you. 





###### 18 


A man who bears false witness against his neighbor is like a war club, or a sword, or a sharp arrow. 





###### 19 


Trusting in a treacherous man in time of trouble is like a bad tooth or a foot that slips. 





###### 20 


Whoever sings songs to a heavy heart is like one who takes off a garment on a cold day, and like vinegar on soda. 





###### 21 


If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink, 





###### 22 


for you will heap burning coals on his head, and the LORD will reward you. 





###### 23 


The north wind brings forth rain, and a backbiting tongue, angry looks. 





###### 24 


It is better to live in a corner of the housetop than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife. 





###### 25 


Like cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country. 





###### 26 


Like a muddied spring or a polluted fountain is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked. 





###### 27 


It is not good to eat much honey, nor is it glorious to seek one's own glory. 





###### 28 


A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
