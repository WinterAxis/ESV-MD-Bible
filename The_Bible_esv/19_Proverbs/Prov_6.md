###### 1 

My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, have given your pledge for a stranger, 

###### 2 

if you are snared in the words of your mouth, caught in the words of your mouth, 

###### 3 

then do this, my son, and save yourself, for you have come into the hand of your neighbor: go, hasten, and plead urgently with your neighbor. 

###### 4 

Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber; 

###### 5 

save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler. 

###### 6 

Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise. 

###### 7 

Without having any chief, officer, or ruler, 

###### 8 

she prepares her bread in summer and gathers her food in harvest. 

###### 9 

How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep? 

###### 10 

A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, 

###### 11 

and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man. 

###### 12 

A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech, 

###### 13 

winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger, 

###### 14 

with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord; 

###### 15 

therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing. 

###### 16 

There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are an abomination to him: 

###### 17 

haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 

###### 18 

a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, 

###### 19 

a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers. ## Warnings Against Adultery 

###### 20 

My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching. 

###### 21 

Bind them on your heart always; tie them around your neck. 

###### 22 

When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you. 

###### 23 

For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life, 

###### 24 

to preserve you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress. 

###### 25 

Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes; 

###### 26 

for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread, but a married woman hunts down a precious life. 

###### 27 

Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned? 

###### 28 

Or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched? 

###### 29 

So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; none who touches her will go unpunished. 

###### 30 

People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry, 

###### 31 

but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house. 

###### 32 

He who commits adultery lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself. 

###### 33 

He will get wounds and dishonor, and his disgrace will not be wiped away. 

###### 34 

For jealousy makes a man furious, and he will not spare when he takes revenge. 

###### 35 

He will accept no compensation; he will refuse though you multiply gifts.
