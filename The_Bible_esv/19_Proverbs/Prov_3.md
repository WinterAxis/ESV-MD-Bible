###### 1 

My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments, 

###### 2 

for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you. 

###### 3 

Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 

###### 4 

So you will find favor and good success in the sight of God and man. 

###### 5 

Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. 

###### 6 

In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. 

###### 7 

Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD, and turn away from evil. 

###### 8 

It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones. 

###### 9 

Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce; 

###### 10 

then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine. 

###### 11 

My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline or be weary of his reproof, 

###### 12 

for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights. ## Blessed Is the One Who Finds Wisdom 

###### 13 

Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding, 

###### 14 

for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold. 

###### 15 

She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her. 

###### 16 

Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. 

###### 17 

Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. 

###### 18 

She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed. 

###### 19 

The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens; 

###### 20 

by his knowledge the deeps broke open, and the clouds drop down the dew. 

###### 21 

My son, do not lose sight of these-- keep sound wisdom and discretion, 

###### 22 

and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck. 

###### 23 

Then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot will not stumble. 

###### 24 

If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet. 

###### 25 

Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes, 

###### 26 

for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught. 

###### 27 

Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it. 

###### 28 

Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give it"--when you have it with you. 

###### 29 

Do not plan evil against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you. 

###### 30 

Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm. 

###### 31 

Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways, 

###### 32 

for the devious person is an abomination to the LORD, but the upright are in his confidence. 

###### 33 

The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous. 

###### 34 

Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he gives favor. 

###### 35 

The wise will inherit honor, but fools get disgrace.
