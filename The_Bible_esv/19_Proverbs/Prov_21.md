###### 1 


The king's heart is a stream of water in the hand of the LORD; he turns it wherever he will. 





###### 2 


Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the heart. 





###### 3 


To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice. 





###### 4 


Haughty eyes and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, are sin. 





###### 5 


The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance, but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty. 





###### 6 


The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a snare of death. 





###### 7 


The violence of the wicked will sweep them away, because they refuse to do what is just. 





###### 8 


The way of the guilty is crooked, but the conduct of the pure is upright. 





###### 9 


It is better to live in a corner of the housetop than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife. 





###### 10 


The soul of the wicked desires evil; his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes. 





###### 11 


When a scoffer is punished, the simple becomes wise; when a wise man is instructed, he gains knowledge. 





###### 12 


The Righteous One observes the house of the wicked; he throws the wicked down to ruin. 





###### 13 


Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor will himself call out and not be answered. 





###### 14 


A gift in secret averts anger, and a concealed bribe, strong wrath. 





###### 15 


When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers. 





###### 16 


One who wanders from the way of good sense will rest in the assembly of the dead. 





###### 17 


Whoever loves pleasure will be a poor man; he who loves wine and oil will not be rich. 





###### 18 


The wicked is a ransom for the righteous, and the traitor for the upright. 





###### 19 


It is better to live in a desert land than with a quarrelsome and fretful woman. 





###### 20 


Precious treasure and oil are in a wise man's dwelling, but a foolish man devours it. 





###### 21 


Whoever pursues righteousness and kindness will find life, righteousness, and honor. 





###### 22 


A wise man scales the city of the mighty and brings down the stronghold in which they trust. 





###### 23 


Whoever keeps his mouth and his tongue keeps himself out of trouble. 





###### 24 


"Scoffer" is the name of the arrogant, haughty man who acts with arrogant pride. 





###### 25 


The desire of the sluggard kills him, for his hands refuse to labor. 





###### 26 


All day long he craves and craves, but the righteous gives and does not hold back. 





###### 27 


The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; how much more when he brings it with evil intent. 





###### 28 


A false witness will perish, but the word of a man who hears will endure. 





###### 29 


A wicked man puts on a bold face, but the upright gives thought to his ways. 





###### 30 


No wisdom, no understanding, no counsel can avail against the LORD. 





###### 31 


The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but the victory belongs to the LORD. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
