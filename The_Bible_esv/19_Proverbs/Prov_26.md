***






###### 1 


Like snow in summer or rain in harvest, so honor is not fitting for a fool. 





###### 2 


Like a sparrow in its flitting, like a swallow in its flying, a curse that is causeless does not alight. 





###### 3 


A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the back of fools. 





###### 4 


Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest you be like him yourself. 





###### 5 


Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes. 





###### 6 


Whoever sends a message by the hand of a fool cuts off his own feet and drinks violence. 





###### 7 


Like a lame man's legs, which hang useless, is a proverb in the mouth of fools. 





###### 8 


Like one who binds the stone in the sling is one who gives honor to a fool. 





###### 9 


Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in the mouth of fools. 





###### 10 


Like an archer who wounds everyone is one who hires a passing fool or drunkard. 





###### 11 


Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly. 





###### 12 


Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him. 





###### 13 


The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road! There is a lion in the streets!" 





###### 14 


As a door turns on its hinges, so does a sluggard on his bed. 





###### 15 


The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; it wears him out to bring it back to his mouth. 





###### 16 


The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who can answer sensibly. 





###### 17 


Whoever meddles in a quarrel not his own is like one who takes a passing dog by the ears. 





###### 18 


Like a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death 





###### 19 


is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, "I am only joking!" 





###### 20 


For lack of wood the fire goes out, and where there is no whisperer, quarreling ceases. 





###### 21 


As charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife. 





###### 22 


The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels; they go down into the inner parts of the body. 





###### 23 


Like the glaze covering an earthen vessel are fervent lips with an evil heart. 





###### 24 


Whoever hates disguises himself with his lips and harbors deceit in his heart; 





###### 25 


when he speaks graciously, believe him not, for there are seven abominations in his heart; 





###### 26 


though his hatred be covered with deception, his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly. 





###### 27 


Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, and a stone will come back on him who starts it rolling. 





###### 28 


A lying tongue hates its victims, and a flattering mouth works ruin. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
