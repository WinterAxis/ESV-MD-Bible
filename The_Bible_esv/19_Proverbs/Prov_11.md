###### 1 

A false balance is an abomination to the LORD, but a just weight is his delight. 

###### 2 

When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom. 

###### 3 

The integrity of the upright guides them, but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them. 

###### 4 

Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death. 

###### 5 

The righteousness of the blameless keeps his way straight, but the wicked falls by his own wickedness. 

###### 6 

The righteousness of the upright delivers them, but the treacherous are taken captive by their lust. 

###### 7 

When the wicked dies, his hope will perish, and the expectation of wealth perishes too. 

###### 8 

The righteous is delivered from trouble, and the wicked walks into it instead. 

###### 9 

With his mouth the godless man would destroy his neighbor, but by knowledge the righteous are delivered. 

###### 10 

When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices, and when the wicked perish there are shouts of gladness. 

###### 11 

By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted, but by the mouth of the wicked it is overthrown. 

###### 12 

Whoever belittles his neighbor lacks sense, but a man of understanding remains silent. 

###### 13 

Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets, but he who is trustworthy in spirit keeps a thing covered. 

###### 14 

Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.

Whoever puts up security for a stranger will surely suffer harm, but he who hates striking hands in pledge is secure. 

###### 16 

A gracious woman gets honor, and violent men get riches. 

###### 17 

A man who is kind benefits himself, but a cruel man hurts himself. 

###### 18 

The wicked earns deceptive wages, but one who sows righteousness gets a sure reward. 

###### 19 

Whoever is steadfast in righteousness will live, but he who pursues evil will die. 

###### 20 

Those of crooked heart are an abomination to the LORD, but those of blameless ways are his delight. 

###### 21 

Be assured, an evil person will not go unpunished, but the offspring of the righteous will be delivered. 

###### 22 

Like a gold ring in a pig's snout is a beautiful woman without discretion. 

###### 23 

The desire of the righteous ends only in good, the expectation of the wicked in wrath. 

###### 24 

One gives freely, yet grows all the richer; another withholds what he should give, and only suffers want. 

###### 25 

Whoever brings blessing will be enriched, and one who waters will himself be watered. 

###### 26 

The people curse him who holds back grain, but a blessing is on the head of him who sells it. 

###### 27 

Whoever diligently seeks good seeks favor, but evil comes to him who searches for it. 

###### 28 

Whoever trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf. 

###### 29 

Whoever troubles his own household will inherit the wind, and the fool will be servant to the wise of heart. 

###### 30 

The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and whoever captures souls is wise. 

###### 31 

If the righteous is repaid on earth, how much more the wicked and the sinner!
