###### 1 

Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn her seven pillars. 

###### 2 

She has slaughtered her beasts; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table. 

###### 3 

She has sent out her young women to call from the highest places in the town, 

###### 4 

"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" To him who lacks sense she says, 

###### 5 

"Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed. 

###### 6 

Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight." 

###### 7 

Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse, and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury. 

###### 8 

Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you. 

###### 9 

Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning. 

###### 10 

The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight. 

###### 11 

For by me your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life. 

###### 12 

If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; if you scoff, you alone will bear it. ## The Way of Folly 

###### 13 

The woman Folly is loud; she is seductive and knows nothing. 

###### 14 

She sits at the door of her house; she takes a seat on the highest places of the town, 

###### 15 

calling to those who pass by, who are going straight on their way, 

###### 16 

"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" And to him who lacks sense she says, 

###### 17 

"Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant." 

###### 18 

But he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
