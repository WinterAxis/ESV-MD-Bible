###### 1 

My son, be attentive to my wisdom; incline your ear to my understanding, 

###### 2 

that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge. 

###### 3 

For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil, 

###### 4 

but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. 

###### 5 

Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol; 

###### 6 

she does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it. 

###### 7 

And now, O sons, listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth. 

###### 8 

Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house, 

###### 9 

lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless, 

###### 10 

lest strangers take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner, 

###### 11 

and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed, 

###### 12 

and you say, "How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof! 

###### 13 

I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors. 

###### 14 

I am at the brink of utter ruin in the assembled congregation." 

###### 15 

Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well. 

###### 16 

Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets? 

###### 17 

Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you. 

###### 18 

Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth, 

###### 19 

a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love. 

###### 20 

Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress? 

###### 21 

For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his paths. 

###### 22 

The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin. 

###### 23 

He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray.
