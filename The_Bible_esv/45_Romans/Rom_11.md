###### 1 
I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. 

###### 2 
God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel? 

###### 3 
"Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life." 

###### 4 
But what is God's reply to him? "I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal." 

###### 5 
So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. 

###### 6 
But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. 

###### 7 
What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened, 

###### 8 
as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day." 

###### 9 
And David says, "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them; 

###### 10 
let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs forever." ## Gentiles Grafted In 

###### 11 
So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather, through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous. 

###### 12 
Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean! 

###### 13 
Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry 

###### 14 
in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. 

###### 15 
For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? 

###### 16 
If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches. 

###### 17 
But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree, 

###### 18 
do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. 

###### 19 
Then you will say, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in." 

###### 20 
That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but fear. 

###### 21 
For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. 

###### 22 
Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. 

###### 23 
And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. 

###### 24 
For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree. ## The Mystery of Israel's Salvation 

###### 25 
Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. 

###### 26 
And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, "The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob"; 

###### 27 
"and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins." 

###### 28 
As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. 

###### 29 
For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. 

###### 30 
For just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, 

###### 31 
so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. 

###### 32 
For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all. 

###### 33 
Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! 

###### 34 
"For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?" 

###### 35 
"Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?" 

###### 36 
For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
