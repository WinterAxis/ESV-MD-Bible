###### 1 
So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed: 

###### 2 
shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly; 

###### 3 
not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock. 

###### 4 
And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. 

###### 5 
Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble." 

###### 6 
Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, 

###### 7 
casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you. 

###### 8 
Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. 

###### 9 
Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world. 

###### 10 
And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. 

###### 11 
To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen. ## Final Greetings 

###### 12 
By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I regard him, I have written briefly to you, exhorting and declaring that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it. 

###### 13 
She who is at Babylon, who is likewise chosen, sends you greetings, and so does Mark, my son. 

###### 14 
Greet one another with the kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
