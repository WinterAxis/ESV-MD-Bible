###### 1 
"For behold, in those days and at that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem, 

###### 2 
I will gather all the nations and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. And I will enter into judgment with them there, on behalf of my people and my heritage Israel, because they have scattered them among the nations and have divided up my land, 

###### 3 
and have cast lots for my people, and have traded a boy for a prostitute, and have sold a girl for wine and have drunk it. 

###### 4 
"What are you to me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Are you paying me back for something? If you are paying me back, I will return your payment on your own head swiftly and speedily. 

###### 5 
For you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my rich treasures into your temples. 

###### 6 
You have sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks in order to remove them far from their own border. 

###### 7 
Behold, I will stir them up from the place to which you have sold them, and I will return your payment on your own head. 

###### 8 
I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far away, for the LORD has spoken." 

###### 9 
Proclaim this among the nations: Consecrate for war; stir up the mighty men. Let all the men of war draw near; let them come up. 

###### 10 
Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears; let the weak say, "I am a warrior." 

###### 11 
Hasten and come, all you surrounding nations, and gather yourselves there. Bring down your warriors, O LORD. 

###### 12 
Let the nations stir themselves up and come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat; for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations. 

###### 13 
Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe. Go in, tread, for the winepress is full. The vats overflow, for their evil is great. 

###### 14 
Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision. 

###### 15 
The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining. 

###### 16 
The LORD roars from Zion, and utters his voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the earth quake. But the LORD is a refuge to his people, a stronghold to the people of Israel. ## The Glorious Future of Judah 

###### 17 
"So you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who dwells in Zion, my holy mountain. And Jerusalem shall be holy, and strangers shall never again pass through it. 

###### 18 
"And in that day the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the streambeds of Judah shall flow with water; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of the LORD and water the Valley of Shittim. 

###### 19 
"Egypt shall become a desolation and Edom a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the people of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land. 

###### 20 
But Judah shall be inhabited forever, and Jerusalem to all generations. 

###### 21 
I will avenge their blood, blood I have not avenged, for the LORD dwells in Zion." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
