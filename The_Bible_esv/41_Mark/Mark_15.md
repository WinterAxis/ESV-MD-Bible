###### 1 
And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate. 

###### 2 
And Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" And he answered him, **"You have said so."** 

###### 3 
And the chief priests accused him of many things. 

###### 4 
And Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you." 

###### 5 
But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed. ## Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified 

###### 6 
Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked. 

###### 7 
And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas. 

###### 8 
And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them. 

###### 9 
And he answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?" 

###### 10 
For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. 

###### 11 
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead. 

###### 12 
And Pilate again said to them, "Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?" 

###### 13 
And they cried out again, "Crucify him." 

###### 14 
And Pilate said to them, "Why? What evil has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him." 

###### 15 
So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. ## Jesus Is Mocked 

###### 16 
And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the governor's headquarters), and they called together the whole battalion. 

###### 17 
And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him. 

###### 18 
And they began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!" 

###### 19 
And they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him. 

###### 20 
And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him. ## The Crucifixion 

###### 21 
And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. 

###### 22 
And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull). 

###### 23 
And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. 

###### 24 
And they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take. 

###### 25 
And it was the third hour when they crucified him. 

###### 26 
And the inscription of the charge against him read, "The King of the Jews." 

###### 27 
And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left. 

###### 29 
And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, "Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, 

###### 30 
save yourself, and come down from the cross!" 

###### 31 
So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself. 

###### 32 
Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe." Those who were crucified with him also reviled him. ## The Death of Jesus 

###### 33 
And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. 

###### 34 
And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, **"Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?"** which means, **"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"** 

###### 35 
And some of the bystanders hearing it said, "Behold, he is calling Elijah." 

###### 36 
And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down." 

###### 37 
And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last. 

###### 38 
And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. 

###### 39 
And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!" 

###### 40 
There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. 

###### 41 
When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him, and there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem. ## Jesus Is Buried 

###### 42 
And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, 

###### 43 
Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. 

###### 44 
Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died. And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. 

###### 45 
And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph. 

###### 46 
And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. 

###### 47 
Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
