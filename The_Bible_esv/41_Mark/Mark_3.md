###### 1 
Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there with a withered hand. 

###### 2 
And they watched Jesus, to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him. 

###### 3 
And he said to the man with the withered hand, **"Come here."** 

###### 4 
And he said to them, **"Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?"** But they were silent. 

###### 5 
And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, **"Stretch out your hand."** He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. 

###### 6 
The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him. ## A Great Crowd Follows Jesus 

###### 7 
Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd followed, from Galilee and Judea 

###### 8 
and Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon. When the great crowd heard all that he was doing, they came to him. 

###### 9 
And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they crush him, 

###### 10 
for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed around him to touch him. 

###### 11 
And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God." 

###### 12 
And he strictly ordered them not to make him known. ## The Twelve Apostles 

###### 13 
And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him. 

###### 14 
And he appointed twelve (whom he also named apostles) so that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach 

###### 15 
and have authority to cast out demons. 

###### 16 
He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); 

###### 17 
James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder); 

###### 18 
Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot, 

###### 19 
and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. 

###### 20 
Then he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat. 

###### 21 
And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, "He is out of his mind." ## Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit 

###### 22 
And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, "He is possessed by Beelzebul," and "by the prince of demons he casts out the demons." 

###### 23 
And he called them to him and said to them in parables, **"How can Satan cast out Satan?** 

###### 24 
If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 

###### 25 
And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. 

###### 26 
And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end. 

###### 27 
But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. Then indeed he may plunder his house. 

###### 28 
"Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter, 

###### 29 
but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"-- 

###### 30 
for they were saying, "He has an unclean spirit." ## Jesus' Mother and Brothers 

###### 31 
And his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside they sent to him and called him. 

###### 32 
And a crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, "Your mother and your brothers are outside, seeking you." 

###### 33 
And he answered them, **"Who are my mother and my brothers?"** 

###### 34 
And looking about at those who sat around him, he said, **"Here are my mother and my brothers!** 

###### 35 
For whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
