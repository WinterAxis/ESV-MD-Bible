###### 1 


The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: 





###### 2 


"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Write in a book all the words that I have spoken to you. 





###### 3 


For behold, days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will restore the fortunes of my people, Israel and Judah, says the LORD, and I will bring them back to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall take possession of it." 





###### 4 


These are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and Judah: 





###### 5 


"Thus says the LORD: We have heard a cry of panic, of terror, and no peace. 





###### 6 


Ask now, and see, can a man bear a child? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor? Why has every face turned pale? 





###### 7 


Alas! That day is so great there is none like it; it is a time of distress for Jacob; yet he shall be saved out of it. 





###### 8 


"And it shall come to pass in that day, declares the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and I will burst your bonds, and foreigners shall no more make a servant of him. 





###### 9 


But they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them. 





###### 10 


"Then fear not, O Jacob my servant, declares the LORD, nor be dismayed, O Israel; for behold, I will save you from far away, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease, and none shall make him afraid. 





###### 11 


For I am with you to save you, declares the LORD; I will make a full end of all the nations among whom I scattered you, but of you I will not make a full end. I will discipline you in just measure, and I will by no means leave you unpunished. 





###### 12 


"For thus says the LORD: Your hurt is incurable, and your wound is grievous. 





###### 13 


There is none to uphold your cause, no medicine for your wound, no healing for you. 





###### 14 


All your lovers have forgotten you; they care nothing for you; for I have dealt you the blow of an enemy, the punishment of a merciless foe, because your guilt is great, because your sins are flagrant. 





###### 15 


Why do you cry out over your hurt? Your pain is incurable. Because your guilt is great, because your sins are flagrant, I have done these things to you. 





###### 16 


Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured, and all your foes, every one of them, shall go into captivity; those who plunder you shall be plundered, and all who prey on you I will make a prey. 





###### 17 


For I will restore health to you, and your wounds I will heal, declares the LORD, because they have called you an outcast: 'It is Zion, for whom no one cares!' 





###### 18 


"Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob and have compassion on his dwellings; the city shall be rebuilt on its mound, and the palace shall stand where it used to be. 





###### 19 


Out of them shall come songs of thanksgiving, and the voices of those who celebrate. I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will make them honored, and they shall not be small. 





###### 20 


Their children shall be as they were of old, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all who oppress them. 





###### 21 


Their prince shall be one of themselves; their ruler shall come out from their midst; I will make him draw near, and he shall approach me, for who would dare of himself to approach me? declares the LORD. 





###### 22 


And you shall be my people, and I will be your God." 





###### 23 


Behold the storm of the LORD! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the head of the wicked. 





###### 24 


The fierce anger of the LORD will not turn back until he has executed and accomplished the intentions of his mind.
