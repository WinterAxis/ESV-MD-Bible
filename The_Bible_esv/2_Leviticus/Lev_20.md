###### 1 


The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 





###### 2 


"Say to the people of Israel, Any one of the people of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn in Israel who gives any of his children to Molech shall surely be put to death. The people of the land shall stone him with stones. 





###### 3 


I myself will set my face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given one of his children to Molech, to make my sanctuary unclean and to profane my holy name. 





###### 4 


And if the people of the land do at all close their eyes to that man when he gives one of his children to Molech, and do not put him to death, 





###### 5 


then I will set my face against that man and against his clan and will cut them off from among their people, him and all who follow him in whoring after Molech. 





###### 6 


"If a person turns to mediums and necromancers, whoring after them, I will set my face against that person and will cut him off from among his people. 





###### 7 


Consecrate yourselves, therefore, and be holy, for I am the LORD your God. 





###### 8 


Keep my statutes and do them; I am the LORD who sanctifies you. 





###### 9 


For anyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death; he has cursed his father or his mother; his blood is upon him. ## Punishments for Sexual Immorality
