Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Eliehoenai the seventh. 

###### 4 

And Obed-edom had sons: Shemaiah the firstborn, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sachar the fourth, Nethanel the fifth, 

###### 5 

Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peullethai the eighth, for God blessed him. 

###### 6 

Also to his son Shemaiah were sons born who were rulers in their fathers' houses, for they were men of great ability. 

###### 7 

The sons of Shemaiah: Othni, Rephael, Obed and Elzabad, whose brothers were able men, Elihu and Semachiah.

###### 11 

Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the sons and brothers of Hosah were thirteen.

###### 13 

And they cast lots by fathers' houses, small and great alike, for their gates.

Obed-edom's came out for the south, and to his sons was allotted the gatehouse. 

###### 16 

For Shuppim and Hosah it came out for the west, at the gate of Shallecheth on the road that goes up. Watch corresponded to watch. 

###### 17 

On the east there were six each day, on the north four each day, on the south four each day, as well as two and two at the gatehouse. 

###### 18 

And for the colonnade on the west there were four at the road and two at the colonnade. 

###### 19 

These were the divisions of the gatekeepers among the Korahites and the sons of Merari. ## Treasurers and Other Officials
