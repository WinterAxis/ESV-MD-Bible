###### 1 


Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession, 





###### 2 


who was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house. 





###### 3 


For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses--as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself. 





###### 4 


(For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.) 





###### 5 


Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later, 





###### 6 


but Christ is faithful over God's house as a son. And we are his house, if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope. ## A Rest for the People of God 





###### 7 


Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "Today, if you hear his voice, 





###### 8 


do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness, 





###### 9 


where your fathers put me to the test and saw my works for forty years. 





###### 10 


Therefore I was provoked with that generation, and said, 'They always go astray in their heart; they have not known my ways.' 





###### 11 


As I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter my rest.'" 





###### 12 


Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. 





###### 13 


But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called "today," that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. 





###### 14 


For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end. 





###### 15 


As it is said, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion." 





###### 16 


For who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses? 





###### 17 


And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? 





###### 18 


And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient? 





###### 19 


So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
