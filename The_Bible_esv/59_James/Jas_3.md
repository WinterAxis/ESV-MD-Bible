###### 1 
Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. 

###### 2 
For we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body. 

###### 3 
If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well. 

###### 4 
Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. 

###### 5 
So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things. How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire! 

###### 6 
And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell. 

###### 7 
For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind, 

###### 8 
but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. 

###### 9 
With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God. 

###### 10 
From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. 

###### 11 
Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water? 

###### 12 
Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water. ## Wisdom from Above 

###### 13 
Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom. 

###### 14 
But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth. 

###### 15 
This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. 

###### 16 
For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice. 

###### 17 
But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere. 

###### 18 
And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
