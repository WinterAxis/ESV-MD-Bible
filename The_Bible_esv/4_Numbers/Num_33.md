###### 36 
And they set out from Ezion-geber and camped in the wilderness of Zin (that is, Kadesh). 

###### 37 
And they set out from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the edge of the land of Edom. 

###### 38

###### 50 
And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, 

###### 51 
"Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 

###### 52 
then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their figured stones and destroy all their metal images and demolish all their high places. 

###### 53 
And you shall take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given the land to you to possess it. 

###### 54 
You shall inherit the land by lot according to your clans. To a large tribe you shall give a large inheritance, and to a small tribe you shall give a small inheritance. Wherever the lot falls for anyone, that shall be his. According to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit. 

###### 55 
But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those of them whom you let remain shall be as barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they shall trouble you in the land where you dwell. 

###### 56 
And I will do to you as I thought to do to them."
