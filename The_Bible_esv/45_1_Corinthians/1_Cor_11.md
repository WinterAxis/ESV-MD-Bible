###### 1 


Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ. ## Head Coverings 





###### 2 


Now I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions even as I delivered them to you. 





###### 3 


But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God. 





###### 4 


Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head, 





###### 5 


but every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since it is the same as if her head were shaven. 





###### 6 


For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head. 





###### 7 


For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. 





###### 8 


For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. 





###### 9 


Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. 





###### 10 


That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. 





###### 11 


Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman; 





###### 12 


for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God. 





###### 13 


Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered? 





###### 14 


Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him, 





###### 15 


but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering. 





###### 16 


If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God. ## The Lord's Supper 





###### 17 


But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse. 





###### 18 


For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, 





###### 19 


for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized. 





###### 20 


When you come together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat. 





###### 21 


For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, another gets drunk. 





###### 22 


What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not. 





###### 23 


For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, 





###### 24 


and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, **"This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me."** 





###### 25 


In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, **"This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me."** 





###### 26 


For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. 





###### 27 


Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. 





###### 28 


Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. 





###### 29 


For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. 





###### 30 


That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. 





###### 31 


But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. 





###### 32 


But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world. 





###### 33 


So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another-- 





###### 34 


if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home--so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
