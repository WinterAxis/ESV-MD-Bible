###### 1 

Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also are to do. 

###### 2 

On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that there will be no collecting when I come. 

###### 3 

And when I arrive, I will send those whom you accredit by letter to carry your gift to Jerusalem. 

###### 4 

If it seems advisable that I should go also, they will accompany me. ## Plans for Travel 

###### 5 

I will visit you after passing through Macedonia, for I intend to pass through Macedonia, 

###### 6 

and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may help me on my journey, wherever I go. 

###### 7 

For I do not want to see you now just in passing. I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. 

###### 8 

But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, 

###### 9 

for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries. 

###### 10 

When Timothy comes, see that you put him at ease among you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, as I am. 

###### 11 

So let no one despise him. Help him on his way in peace, that he may return to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers. ## Final Instructions 

###### 12 

Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but it was not at all his will to come now. He will come when he has opportunity. 

###### 13 

Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. 

###### 14 

Let all that you do be done in love. 

###### 15 

Now I urge you, brothers--you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints-- 

###### 16 

be subject to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer. 

###### 17 

I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for your absence, 

###### 18 

for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Give recognition to such people. ## Greetings 

###### 19 

The churches of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church in their house, send you hearty greetings in the Lord. 

###### 20 

All the brothers send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss. 

###### 21 

I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. 

###### 22 

If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed. Our Lord, come! 

###### 23 

The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. 

###### 24 

My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
