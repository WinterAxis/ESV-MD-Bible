###### 1 


I am speaking the truth in Christ--I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit-- 





###### 2 


that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. 





###### 3 


For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh. 





###### 4 


They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises. 





###### 5 


To them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen. 





###### 6 


But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel, 





###### 7 


and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but "Through Isaac shall your offspring be named." 





###### 8 


This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring. 





###### 9 


For this is what the promise said: "About this time next year I will return, and Sarah shall have a son." 





###### 10 


And not only so, but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac, 





###### 11 


though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad--in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls-- 





###### 12 


she was told, "The older will serve the younger." 





###### 13 


As it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated." 





###### 14 


What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means! 





###### 15 


For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion." 





###### 16 


So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy. 





###### 17 


For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth." 





###### 18 


So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills. 





###### 19 


You will say to me then, "Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?" 





###### 20 


But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, "Why have you made me like this?" 





###### 21 


Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use? 





###### 22 


What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, 





###### 23 


in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory-- 





###### 24 


even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles? 





###### 25 


As indeed he says in Hosea, "Those who were not my people I will call 'my people,' and her who was not beloved I will call 'beloved.'" 





###### 26 


"And in the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they will be called 'sons of the living God.'" 





###### 27 


And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: "Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will be saved, 





###### 28 


for the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and without delay." 





###### 29 


And as Isaiah predicted, "If the Lord of hosts had not left us offspring, we would have been like Sodom and become like Gomorrah." ## Israel's Unbelief 





###### 30 


What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; 





###### 31 


but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. 





###### 32 


Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, 





###### 33 


as it is written, "Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
