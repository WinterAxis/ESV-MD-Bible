###### 1 

How the gold has grown dim, how the pure gold is changed! The holy stones lie scattered at the head of every street. 

###### 2 

The precious sons of Zion, worth their weight in fine gold, how they are regarded as earthen pots, the work of a potter's hands! 

###### 3 

Even jackals offer the breast; they nurse their young; but the daughter of my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness. 

###### 4 

The tongue of the nursing infant sticks to the roof of its mouth for thirst; the children beg for food, but no one gives to them. 

###### 5 

Those who once feasted on delicacies perish in the streets; those who were brought up in purple embrace ash heaps. 

###### 6 

For the chastisement of the daughter of my people has been greater than the punishment of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, and no hands were wrung for her. 

###### 7 

Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than coral, the beauty of their form was like sapphire. 

###### 8 

Now their face is blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets; their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as wood. 

###### 9 

Happier were the victims of the sword than the victims of hunger, who wasted away, pierced by lack of the fruits of the field. 

###### 10 

The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children; they became their food during the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

###### 11 

The LORD gave full vent to his wrath; he poured out his hot anger, and he kindled a fire in Zion that consumed its foundations. 

###### 12 

The kings of the earth did not believe, nor any of the inhabitants of the world, that foe or enemy could enter the gates of Jerusalem. 

###### 13 

This was for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed in the midst of her the blood of the righteous. 

###### 14 

They wandered, blind, through the streets; they were so defiled with blood that no one was able to touch their garments. 

###### 15 

"Away! Unclean!" people cried at them. "Away! Away! Do not touch!" So they became fugitives and wanderers; people said among the nations, "They shall stay with us no longer." 

###### 16 

The LORD himself has scattered them; he will regard them no more; no honor was shown to the priests, no favor to the elders. 

###### 17 

Our eyes failed, ever watching vainly for help; in our watching we watched for a nation which could not save. 

###### 18 

They dogged our steps so that we could not walk in our streets; our end drew near; our days were numbered, for our end had come. 

###### 19 

Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles in the heavens; they chased us on the mountains; they lay in wait for us in the wilderness. 

###### 20 

The breath of our nostrils, the LORD's anointed, was captured in their pits, of whom we said, "Under his shadow we shall live among the nations." 

###### 21 

Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, you who dwell in the land of Uz; but to you also the cup shall pass; you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare. 

###### 22 

The punishment of your iniquity, O daughter of Zion, is accomplished; he will keep you in exile no longer; but your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he will punish; he will uncover your sins.
