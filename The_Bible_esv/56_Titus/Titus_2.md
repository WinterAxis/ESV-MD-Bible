###### 1 
But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine. 

###### 2 
Older men are to be sober-minded, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness. 

###### 3 
Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is good, 

###### 4 
and so train the young women to love their husbands and children, 

###### 5 
to be self-controlled, pure, working at home, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be reviled. 

###### 6 
Likewise, urge the younger men to be self-controlled. 

###### 7 
Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good works, and in your teaching show integrity, dignity, 

###### 8 
and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us. 

###### 9 
Bondservants are to be submissive to their own masters in everything; they are to be well-pleasing, not argumentative, 

###### 10 
not pilfering, but showing all good faith, so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior. 

###### 11 
For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, 

###### 12 
training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, 

###### 13 
waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, 

###### 14 
who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works. 

###### 15 
Declare these things; exhort and rebuke with all authority.
