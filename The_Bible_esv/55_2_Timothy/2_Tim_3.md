###### 1 
But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. 

###### 2 
For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 

###### 3 
heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, 

###### 4 
treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 

###### 5 
having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people. 

###### 6 
For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, 

###### 7 
always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. 

###### 8 
Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith. 

###### 9 
But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men. ## All Scripture Is Breathed Out by God 

###### 10 
You, however, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness, 

###### 11 
my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra--which persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me. 

###### 12 
Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, 

###### 13 
while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. 

###### 14 
But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it 

###### 15 
and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 

###### 16 
All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, 

###### 17 
that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
