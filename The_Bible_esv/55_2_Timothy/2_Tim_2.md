###### 1 
You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus, 

###### 2 
and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also. 

###### 3 
Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 

###### 4 
No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him. 

###### 5 
An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. 

###### 6 
It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops. 

###### 7 
Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything. 

###### 8 
Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel, 

###### 9 
for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound! 

###### 10 
Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 

###### 11 
The saying is trustworthy, for: If we have died with him, we will also live with him; 

###### 12 
if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us; 

###### 13 
if we are faithless, he remains faithful-- for he cannot deny himself. ## A Worker Approved by God 

###### 14 
Remind them of these things, and charge them before God not to quarrel about words, which does no good, but only ruins the hearers. 

###### 15 
Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. 

###### 16 
But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness, 

###### 17 
and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, 

###### 18 
who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some. 

###### 19 
But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity." 

###### 20 
Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable. 

###### 21 
Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work. 

###### 22 
So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. 

###### 23 
Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they breed quarrels. 

###### 24 
And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, 

###### 25 
correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, 

###### 26 
and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.
