###### 1 
Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker 

###### 2 
and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house: 

###### 3 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ## Philemon's Love and Faith 

###### 4 
I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers, 

###### 5 
because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints, 

###### 6 
and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ. 

###### 7 
For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you. ## Paul's Plea for Onesimus 

###### 8 
Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, 

###### 9 
yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you--I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus-- 

###### 10 
I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment. 

###### 11 
(Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.) 

###### 12 
I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart. 

###### 13 
I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel, 

###### 14 
but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own accord. 

###### 15 
For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever, 

###### 16 
no longer as a bondservant but more than a bondservant, as a beloved brother--especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 

###### 17 
So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me. 

###### 18 
If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. 

###### 19 
I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it--to say nothing of your owing me even your own self. 

###### 20 
Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ. 

###### 21 
Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. 

###### 22 
At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you. ## Final Greetings 

###### 23 
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you, 

###### 24 
and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. 

###### 25 
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
