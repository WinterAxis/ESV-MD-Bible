###### 1 

Woe to those who devise wickedness and work evil on their beds! When the morning dawns, they perform it, because it is in the power of their hand. 

###### 2 

They covet fields and seize them, and houses, and take them away; they oppress a man and his house, a man and his inheritance. 

###### 3 

Therefore thus says the LORD: behold, against this family I am devising disaster, from which you cannot remove your necks, and you shall not walk haughtily, for it will be a time of disaster. 

###### 4 

In that day they shall take up a taunt song against you and moan bitterly, and say, "We are utterly ruined; he changes the portion of my people; how he removes it from me! To an apostate he allots our fields." 

###### 5 

Therefore you will have none to cast the line by lot in the assembly of the LORD. 

###### 6 

"Do not preach"--thus they preach-- "one should not preach of such things; disgrace will not overtake us." 

###### 7 

Should this be said, O house of Jacob? Has the LORD grown impatient? Are these his deeds? Do not my words do good to him who walks uprightly? 

###### 8 

But lately my people have risen up as an enemy; you strip the rich robe from those who pass by trustingly with no thought of war. 

###### 9 

The women of my people you drive out from their delightful houses; from their young children you take away my splendor forever. 

###### 10 

Arise and go, for this is no place to rest, because of uncleanness that destroys with a grievous destruction. 

###### 11 

If a man should go about and utter wind and lies, saying, "I will preach to you of wine and strong drink," he would be the preacher for this people! 

###### 12 

I will surely assemble all of you, O Jacob; I will gather the remnant of Israel; I will set them together like sheep in a fold, like a flock in its pasture, a noisy multitude of men. 

###### 13 

He who opens the breach goes up before them; they break through and pass the gate, going out by it. Their king passes on before them, the LORD at their head.
