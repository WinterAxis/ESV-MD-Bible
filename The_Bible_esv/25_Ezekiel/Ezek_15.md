###### 1 


And the word of the LORD came to me: 





###### 2 


"Son of man, how does the wood of the vine surpass any wood, the vine branch that is among the trees of the forest? 





###### 3 


Is wood taken from it to make anything? Do people take a peg from it to hang any vessel on it? 





###### 4 


Behold, it is given to the fire for fuel. When the fire has consumed both ends of it, and the middle of it is charred, is it useful for anything? 





###### 5 


Behold, when it was whole, it was used for nothing. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it ever be used for anything! 





###### 6 


Therefore thus says the Lord God: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 





###### 7 


And I will set my face against them. Though they escape from the fire, the fire shall yet consume them, and you will know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them. 





###### 8 


And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted faithlessly, declares the Lord God." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
