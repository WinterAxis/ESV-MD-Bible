The LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying, 

###### 2 

"Take a census of all the congregation of the people of Israel, by clans, by fathers' houses, according to the number of names, every male, head by head. 

###### 3 

From twenty years old and upward, all in Israel who are able to go to war, you and Aaron shall list them, company by company. 

###### 4 

And there shall be with you a man from each tribe, each man being the head of the house of his fathers.

###### 46 

all those listed were 603,550. ## Levites Exempted 

###### 47 

But the Levites were not listed along with them by their ancestral tribe. 

###### 48 

For the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 

###### 49 

"Only the tribe of Levi you shall not list, and you shall not take a census of them among the people of Israel. 

###### 50 

But appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings, and they shall take care of it and shall camp around the tabernacle. 

###### 51 

When the tabernacle is to set out, the Levites shall take it down, and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up. And if any outsider comes near, he shall be put to death. 

###### 52 

The people of Israel shall pitch their tents by their companies, each man in his own camp and each man by his own standard. 

###### 53 

But the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the testimony, so that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the people of Israel. And the Levites shall keep guard over the tabernacle of the testimony." 

###### 54 

Thus did the people of Israel; they did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses.
