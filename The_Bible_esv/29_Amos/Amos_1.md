###### 2 

And he said: "The LORD roars from Zion and utters his voice from Jerusalem; the pastures of the shepherds mourn, and the top of Carmel withers." 

###### 3 

Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because they have threshed Gilead with threshing sledges of iron. 

###### 4 

So I will send a fire upon the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad. 

###### 5 

I will break the gate-bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitants from the Valley of Aven, and him who holds the scepter from Beth-eden; and the people of Syria shall go into exile to Kir," says the LORD. 

###### 6 

Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because they carried into exile a whole people to deliver them up to Edom. 

###### 7 

So I will send a fire upon the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour her strongholds. 

###### 8 

I will cut off the inhabitants from Ashdod, and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon; I will turn my hand against Ekron, and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish," says the Lord God. 

###### 9 

Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because they delivered up a whole people to Edom, and did not remember the covenant of brotherhood. 

###### 10 

So I will send a fire upon the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour her strongholds." 

###### 11 

Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because he pursued his brother with the sword and cast off all pity, and his anger tore perpetually, and he kept his wrath forever. 

###### 12 

So I will send a fire upon Teman, and it shall devour the strongholds of Bozrah." 

###### 13 

Thus says the LORD: "For three transgressions of the Ammonites, and for four, I will not revoke the punishment, because they have ripped open pregnant women in Gilead, that they might enlarge their border. 

###### 14 

So I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour her strongholds, with shouting on the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind; 

###### 15 

and their king shall go into exile, he and his princes together," says the LORD.
