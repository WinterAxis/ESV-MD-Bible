###### 1 
Does not wisdom call? Does not understanding raise her voice? 

###### 2 
On the heights beside the way, at the crossroads she takes her stand; 

###### 3 
beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud: 

###### 4 
"To you, O men, I call, and my cry is to the children of man. 

###### 5 
O simple ones, learn prudence; O fools, learn sense. 

###### 6 
Hear, for I will speak noble things, and from my lips will come what is right, 

###### 7 
for my mouth will utter truth; wickedness is an abomination to my lips. 

###### 8 
All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing twisted or crooked in them. 

###### 9 
They are all straight to him who understands, and right to those who find knowledge. 

###### 10 
Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold, 

###### 11 
for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her. 

###### 12 
"I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion. 

###### 13 
The fear of the LORD is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate. 

###### 14 
I have counsel and sound wisdom; I have insight; I have strength. 

###### 15 
By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just; 

###### 16 
by me princes rule, and nobles, all who govern justly. 

###### 17 
I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me. 

###### 18 
Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness. 

###### 19 
My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my yield than choice silver. 

###### 20 
I walk in the way of righteousness, in the paths of justice, 

###### 21 
granting an inheritance to those who love me, and filling their treasuries. 

###### 22 
"The LORD possessed me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of old. 

###### 23 
Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth. 

###### 24 
When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water. 

###### 25 
Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth, 

###### 26 
before he had made the earth with its fields, or the first of the dust of the world. 

###### 27 
When he established the heavens, I was there; when he drew a circle on the face of the deep, 

###### 28 
when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep, 

###### 29 
when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth, 

###### 30 
then I was beside him, like a master workman, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always, 

###### 31 
rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the children of man. 

###### 32 
"And now, O sons, listen to me: blessed are those who keep my ways. 

###### 33 
Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it. 

###### 34 
Blessed is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors. 

###### 35 
For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the LORD, 

###### 36 
but he who fails to find me injures himself; all who hate me love death." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
