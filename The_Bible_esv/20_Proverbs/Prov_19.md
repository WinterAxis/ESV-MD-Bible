###### 1 
Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool. 

###### 2 
Desire without knowledge is not good, and whoever makes haste with his feet misses his way. 

###### 3 
When a man's folly brings his way to ruin, his heart rages against the LORD. 

###### 4 
Wealth brings many new friends, but a poor man is deserted by his friend. 

###### 5 
A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who breathes out lies will not escape. 

###### 6 
Many seek the favor of a generous man, and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts. 

###### 7 
All a poor man's brothers hate him; how much more do his friends go far from him! He pursues them with words, but does not have them. 

###### 8 
Whoever gets sense loves his own soul; he who keeps understanding will discover good. 

###### 9 
A false witness will not go unpunished, and he who breathes out lies will perish. 

###### 10 
It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury, much less for a slave to rule over princes. 

###### 11 
Good sense makes one slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense. 

###### 12 
A king's wrath is like the growling of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass. 

###### 13 
A foolish son is ruin to his father, and a wife's quarreling is a continual dripping of rain. 

###### 14 
House and wealth are inherited from fathers, but a prudent wife is from the LORD. 

###### 15 
Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep, and an idle person will suffer hunger. 

###### 16 
Whoever keeps the commandment keeps his life; he who despises his ways will die. 

###### 17 
Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the LORD, and he will repay him for his deed. 

###### 18 
Discipline your son, for there is hope; do not set your heart on putting him to death. 

###### 19 
A man of great wrath will pay the penalty, for if you deliver him, you will only have to do it again. 

###### 20 
Listen to advice and accept instruction, that you may gain wisdom in the future. 

###### 21 
Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the LORD that will stand. 

###### 22 
What is desired in a man is steadfast love, and a poor man is better than a liar. 

###### 23 
The fear of the LORD leads to life, and whoever has it rests satisfied; he will not be visited by harm. 

###### 24 
The sluggard buries his hand in the dish and will not even bring it back to his mouth. 

###### 25 
Strike a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; reprove a man of understanding, and he will gain knowledge. 

###### 26 
He who does violence to his father and chases away his mother is a son who brings shame and reproach. 

###### 27 
Cease to hear instruction, my son, and you will stray from the words of knowledge. 

###### 28 
A worthless witness mocks at justice, and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity. 

###### 29 
Condemnation is ready for scoffers, and beating for the backs of fools. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
