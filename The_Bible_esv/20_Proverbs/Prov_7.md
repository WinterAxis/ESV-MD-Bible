###### 1 
My son, keep my words and treasure up my commandments with you; 

###### 2 
keep my commandments and live; keep my teaching as the apple of your eye; 

###### 3 
bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 

###### 4 
Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call insight your intimate friend, 

###### 5 
to keep you from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words. 

###### 6 
For at the window of my house I have looked out through my lattice, 

###### 7 
and I have seen among the simple, I have perceived among the youths, a young man lacking sense, 

###### 8 
passing along the street near her corner, taking the road to her house 

###### 9 
in the twilight, in the evening, at the time of night and darkness. 

###### 10 
And behold, the woman meets him, dressed as a prostitute, wily of heart. 

###### 11 
She is loud and wayward; her feet do not stay at home; 

###### 12 
now in the street, now in the market, and at every corner she lies in wait. 

###### 13 
She seizes him and kisses him, and with bold face she says to him, 

###### 14 
"I had to offer sacrifices, and today I have paid my vows; 

###### 15 
so now I have come out to meet you, to seek you eagerly, and I have found you. 

###### 16 
I have spread my couch with coverings, colored linens from Egyptian linen; 

###### 17 
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 

###### 18 
Come, let us take our fill of love till morning; let us delight ourselves with love. 

###### 19 
For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey; 

###### 20 
he took a bag of money with him; at full moon he will come home." 

###### 21 
With much seductive speech she persuades him; with her smooth talk she compels him. 

###### 22 
All at once he follows her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a stag is caught fast 

###### 23 
till an arrow pierces its liver; as a bird rushes into a snare; he does not know that it will cost him his life. 

###### 24 
And now, O sons, listen to me, and be attentive to the words of my mouth. 

###### 25 
Let not your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths, 

###### 26 
for many a victim has she laid low, and all her slain are a mighty throng. 

###### 27 
Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
