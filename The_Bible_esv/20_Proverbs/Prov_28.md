***

###### 1 
The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion. 

###### 2 
When a land transgresses, it has many rulers, but with a man of understanding and knowledge, its stability will long continue. 

###### 3 
A poor man who oppresses the poor is a beating rain that leaves no food. 

###### 4 
Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law strive against them. 

###### 5 
Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek the LORD understand it completely. 

###### 6 
Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways. 

###### 7 
The one who keeps the law is a son with understanding, but a companion of gluttons shames his father. 

###### 8 
Whoever multiplies his wealth by interest and profit gathers it for him who is generous to the poor. 

###### 9 
If one turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination. 

###### 10 
Whoever misleads the upright into an evil way will fall into his own pit, but the blameless will have a goodly inheritance. 

###### 11 
A rich man is wise in his own eyes, but a poor man who has understanding will find him out. 

###### 12 
When the righteous triumph, there is great glory, but when the wicked rise, people hide themselves. 

###### 13 
Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy. 

###### 14 
Blessed is the one who fears the LORD always, but whoever hardens his heart will fall into calamity. 

###### 15 
Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a poor people. 

###### 16 
A ruler who lacks understanding is a cruel oppressor, but he who hates unjust gain will prolong his days. 

###### 17 
If one is burdened with the blood of another, he will be a fugitive until death; let no one help him. 

###### 18 
Whoever walks in integrity will be delivered, but he who is crooked in his ways will suddenly fall. 

###### 19 
Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless pursuits will have plenty of poverty. 

###### 20 
A faithful man will abound with blessings, but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished. 

###### 21 
To show partiality is not good, but for a piece of bread a man will do wrong. 

###### 22 
A stingy man hastens after wealth and does not know that poverty will come upon him. 

###### 23 
Whoever rebukes a man will afterward find more favor than he who flatters with his tongue. 

###### 24 
Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, "That is no transgression," is a companion to a man who destroys. 

###### 25 
A greedy man stirs up strife, but the one who trusts in the LORD will be enriched. 

###### 26 
Whoever trusts in his own mind is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom will be delivered. 

###### 27 
Whoever gives to the poor will not want, but he who hides his eyes will get many a curse. 

###### 28 
When the wicked rise, people hide themselves, but when they perish, the righteous increase.
