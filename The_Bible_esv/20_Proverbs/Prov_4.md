###### 1 
Hear, O sons, a father's instruction, and be attentive, that you may gain insight, 

###### 2 
for I give you good precepts; do not forsake my teaching. 

###### 3 
When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother, 

###### 4 
he taught me and said to me, "Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments, and live. 

###### 5 
Get wisdom; get insight; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth. 

###### 6 
Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you. 

###### 7 
The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight. 

###### 8 
Prize her highly, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her. 

###### 9 
She will place on your head a graceful garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown." 

###### 10 
Hear, my son, and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many. 

###### 11 
I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in the paths of uprightness. 

###### 12 
When you walk, your step will not be hampered, and if you run, you will not stumble. 

###### 13 
Keep hold of instruction; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life. 

###### 14 
Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of the evil. 

###### 15 
Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on. 

###### 16 
For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble. 

###### 17 
For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. 

###### 18 
But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day. 

###### 19 
The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble. 

###### 20 
My son, be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings. 

###### 21 
Let them not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart. 

###### 22 
For they are life to those who find them, and healing to all their flesh. 

###### 23 
Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life. 

###### 24 
Put away from you crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you. 

###### 25 
Let your eyes look directly forward, and your gaze be straight before you. 

###### 26 
Ponder the path of your feet; then all your ways will be sure. 

###### 27 
Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil.
