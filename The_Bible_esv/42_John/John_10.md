###### 1 


"Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber. 





###### 2 


But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 





###### 3 


To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. 





###### 4 


When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. 





###### 5 


A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers." 





###### 6 


This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them. 





###### 7 


So Jesus again said to them, **"Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.** 





###### 8 


All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. 





###### 9 


I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. 





###### 10 


The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. 





###### 11 


I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. 





###### 12 


He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. 





###### 13 


He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. 





###### 14 


I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, 





###### 15 


just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. 





###### 16 


And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd. 





###### 17 


For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. 





###### 18 


No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father." 





###### 19 


There was again a division among the Jews because of these words. 





###### 20 


Many of them said, "He has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him?" 





###### 21 


Others said, "These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?" ## I and the Father Are One 





###### 22 


At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter, 





###### 23 


and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon. 





###### 24 


So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly." 





###### 25 


Jesus answered them, **"I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me,** 





###### 26 


but you do not believe because you are not among my sheep. 





###### 27 


My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. 





###### 28 


I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. 





###### 29 


My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. 





###### 30 


I and the Father are one." 





###### 31 


The Jews picked up stones again to stone him. 





###### 32 


Jesus answered them, **"I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?"** 





###### 33 


The Jews answered him, "It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God." 





###### 34 


Jesus answered them, **"Is it not written in your Law, 'I said, you are gods'?** 





###### 35 


If he called them gods to whom the word of God came--and Scripture cannot be broken-- 





###### 36 


do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'? 





###### 37 


If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me; 





###### 38 


but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father." 





###### 39 


Again they sought to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands. 





###### 40 


He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and there he remained. 





###### 41 


And many came to him. And they said, "John did no sign, but everything that John said about this man was true." 





###### 42 


And many believed in him there. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
