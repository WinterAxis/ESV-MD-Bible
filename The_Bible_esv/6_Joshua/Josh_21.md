###### 42 
These cities each had its pasturelands around it. So it was with all these cities. 

###### 43 
Thus the LORD gave to Israel all the land that he swore to give to their fathers. And they took possession of it, and they settled there. 

###### 44 
And the LORD gave them rest on every side just as he had sworn to their fathers. Not one of all their enemies had withstood them, for the LORD had given all their enemies into their hands. 

###### 45 
Not one word of all the good promises that the LORD had made to the house of Israel had failed; all came to pass.
