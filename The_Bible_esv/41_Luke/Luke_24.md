###### 1 

But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. 

###### 2 

And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, 

###### 3 

but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 

###### 4 

While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel. 

###### 5 

And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead? 

###### 6 

He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, 

###### 7 

that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise." 

###### 8 

And they remembered his words, 

###### 9 

and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. 

###### 10 

Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles, 

###### 11 

but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. 

###### 12 

But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened. ## On the Road to Emmaus 

###### 13 

That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, 

###### 14 

and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. 

###### 15 

While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. 

###### 16 

But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. 

###### 17 

And he said to them, **"What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?"** And they stood still, looking sad. 

###### 18 

Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?" 

###### 19 

And he said to them, **"What things?"** And they said to him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, 

###### 20 

and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. 

###### 21 

But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. 

###### 22 

Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, 

###### 23 

and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. 

###### 24 

Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see." 

###### 25 

And he said to them, **"O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!** 

###### 26 

Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?" 

###### 27 

And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. 

###### 28 

So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, 

###### 29 

but they urged him strongly, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent." So he went in to stay with them. 

###### 30 

When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. 

###### 31 

And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. 

###### 32 

They said to each other, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?" 

###### 33 

And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, 

###### 34 

saying, "The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!" 

###### 35 

Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread. ## Jesus Appears to His Disciples 

###### 36 

As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, **"Peace to you!"** 

###### 37 

But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. 

###### 38 

And he said to them, **"Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?** 

###### 39 

See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have." 

###### 40 

And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. 

###### 41 

And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, **"Have you anything here to eat?"** 

###### 42 

They gave him a piece of broiled fish, 

###### 43 

and he took it and ate before them. 

###### 44 

Then he said to them, **"These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled."** 

###### 45 

Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, 

###### 46 

and said to them, **"Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead,** 

###### 47 

and that repentance for the forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. 

###### 48 

You are witnesses of these things. 

###### 49 

And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high." ## The Ascension 

###### 50 

And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them. 

###### 51 

While he blessed them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven. 

###### 52 

And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, 

###### 53 

and were continually in the temple blessing God.
