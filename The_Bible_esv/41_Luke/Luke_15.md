###### 1 

Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him. 

###### 2 

And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, "This man receives sinners and eats with them." 

###### 3 

So he told them this parable: 

###### 4 

"What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? 

###### 5 

And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 

###### 6 

And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.' 

###### 7 

Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance. ## The Parable of the Lost Coin 

###### 8 

"Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it? 

###### 9 

And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.' 

###### 10 

Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents." ## The Parable of the Prodigal Son 

###### 11 

And he said, **"There was a man who had two sons.** 

###### 12 

And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give me the share of property that is coming to me.' And he divided his property between them. 

###### 13 

Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in reckless living. 

###### 14 

And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need. 

###### 15 

So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. 

###### 16 

And he was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything. 

###### 17 

"But when he came to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger! 

###### 18 

I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. 

###### 19 

I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants."' 

###### 20 

And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. 

###### 21 

And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.' 

###### 22 

But the father said to his servants, 'Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. 

###### 23 

And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. 

###### 24 

For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.' And they began to celebrate. 

###### 25 

"Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. 

###### 26 

And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant. 

###### 27 

And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.' 

###### 28 

But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him, 

###### 29 

but he answered his father, 'Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends. 

###### 30 

But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!' 

###### 31 

And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. 

###### 32 

It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.'"
