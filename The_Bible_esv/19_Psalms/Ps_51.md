###### 1 
Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions. 

###### 2 
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin! 

###### 3 
For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me. 

###### 4 
Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgment. 

###### 5 
Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me. 

###### 6 
Behold, you delight in truth in the inward being, and you teach me wisdom in the secret heart. 

###### 7 
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 

###### 8 
Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice. 

###### 9 
Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. 

###### 10 
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. 

###### 11 
Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me. 

###### 12 
Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit. 

###### 13 
Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you. 

###### 14 
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, O God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness. 

###### 15 
O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise. 

###### 16 
For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; you will not be pleased with a burnt offering. 

###### 17 
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. 

###### 18 
Do good to Zion in your good pleasure; build up the walls of Jerusalem; 

###### 19 
then will you delight in right sacrifices, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on your altar. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
