###### 1 
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 

###### 2 
He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. 

###### 3 
He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 

###### 4 
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 

###### 5 
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 

###### 6 
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD forever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
