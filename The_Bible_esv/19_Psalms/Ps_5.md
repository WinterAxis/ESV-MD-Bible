###### 1 
Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my groaning. 

###### 2 
Give attention to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to you do I pray. 

###### 3 
O LORD, in the morning you hear my voice; in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for you and watch. 

###### 4 
For you are not a God who delights in wickedness; evil may not dwell with you. 

###### 5 
The boastful shall not stand before your eyes; you hate all evildoers. 

###### 6 
You destroy those who speak lies; the LORD abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man. 

###### 7 
But I, through the abundance of your steadfast love, will enter your house. I will bow down toward your holy temple in the fear of you. 

###### 8 
Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before me. 

###### 9 
For there is no truth in their mouth; their inmost self is destruction; their throat is an open grave; they flatter with their tongue. 

###### 10 
Make them bear their guilt, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; because of the abundance of their transgressions cast them out, for they have rebelled against you. 

###### 11 
But let all who take refuge in you rejoice; let them ever sing for joy, and spread your protection over them, that those who love your name may exult in you. 

###### 12 
For you bless the righteous, O LORD; you cover him with favor as with a shield.
