###### 1 
O LORD, who shall sojourn in your tent? Who shall dwell on your holy hill? 

###### 2 
He who walks blamelessly and does what is right and speaks truth in his heart; 

###### 3 
who does not slander with his tongue and does no evil to his neighbor, nor takes up a reproach against his friend; 

###### 4 
in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but who honors those who fear the LORD; who swears to his own hurt and does not change; 

###### 5 
who does not put out his money at interest and does not take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
