Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise him in the heights!

Praise him, all his angels; praise him, all his hosts!

Praise him, sun and moon, praise him, all you shining stars! 

###### 4 
Praise him, you highest heavens, and you waters above the heavens! 

###### 5 
Let them praise the name of the LORD! For he commanded and they were created.

And he established them forever and ever; he gave a decree, and it shall not pass away. 

###### 7 
Praise the LORD from the earth, you great sea creatures and all deeps, 

###### 8 
fire and hail, snow and mist, stormy wind fulfilling his word! 

###### 9 
Mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars! 

###### 10 
Beasts and all livestock, creeping things and flying birds! 

###### 11 
Kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all rulers of the earth!

Young men and maidens together, old men and children! 

###### 13 
Let them praise the name of the LORD, for his name alone is exalted; his majesty is above earth and heaven. 

###### 14 
He has raised up a horn for his people, praise for all his saints, for the people of Israel who are near to him. Praise the LORD!
