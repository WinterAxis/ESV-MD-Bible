###### 1 
In you, O LORD, do I take refuge; let me never be put to shame! 

###### 2 
In your righteousness deliver me and rescue me; incline your ear to me, and save me! 

###### 3 
Be to me a rock of refuge, to which I may continually come; you have given the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress. 

###### 4 
Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and cruel man. 

###### 5 
For you, O Lord, are my hope, my trust, O LORD, from my youth. 

###### 6 
Upon you I have leaned from before my birth; you are he who took me from my mother's womb. My praise is continually of you. 

###### 7 
I have been as a portent to many, but you are my strong refuge. 

###### 8 
My mouth is filled with your praise, and with your glory all the day. 

###### 9 
Do not cast me off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength is spent. 

###### 10 
For my enemies speak concerning me; those who watch for my life consult together 

###### 11 
and say, "God has forsaken him; pursue and seize him, for there is none to deliver him." 

###### 12 
O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me! 

###### 13 
May my accusers be put to shame and consumed; with scorn and disgrace may they be covered who seek my hurt. 

###### 14 
But I will hope continually and will praise you yet more and more. 

###### 15 
My mouth will tell of your righteous acts, of your deeds of salvation all the day, for their number is past my knowledge. 

###### 16 
With the mighty deeds of the Lord God I will come; I will remind them of your righteousness, yours alone. 

###### 17 
O God, from my youth you have taught me, and I still proclaim your wondrous deeds. 

###### 18 
So even to old age and gray hairs, O God, do not forsake me, until I proclaim your might to another generation, your power to all those to come. 

###### 19 
Your righteousness, O God, reaches the high heavens. You who have done great things, O God, who is like you? 

###### 20 
You who have made me see many troubles and calamities will revive me again; from the depths of the earth you will bring me up again. 

###### 21 
You will increase my greatness and comfort me again. 

###### 22 
I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praises to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel. 

###### 23 
My lips will shout for joy, when I sing praises to you; my soul also, which you have redeemed. 

###### 24 
And my tongue will talk of your righteous help all the day long, for they have been put to shame and disappointed who sought to do me hurt. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
