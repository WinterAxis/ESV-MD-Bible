###### 1 
O God, save me by your name, and vindicate me by your might. 

###### 2 
O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth. 

###### 3 
For strangers have risen against me; ruthless men seek my life; they do not set God before themselves. Selah 

###### 4 
Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is the upholder of my life. 

###### 5 
He will return the evil to my enemies; in your faithfulness put an end to them. 

###### 6 
With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you; I will give thanks to your name, O LORD, for it is good. 

###### 7 
For he has delivered me from every trouble, and my eye has looked in triumph on my enemies.
