###### 1 
Sing aloud to God our strength; shout for joy to the God of Jacob! 

###### 2 
Raise a song; sound the tambourine, the sweet lyre with the harp. 

###### 3 
Blow the trumpet at the new moon, at the full moon, on our feast day. 

###### 4 
For it is a statute for Israel, a rule of the God of Jacob. 

###### 5 
He made it a decree in Joseph when he went out over the land of Egypt. I hear a language I had not known: 

###### 6 
"I relieved your shoulder of the burden; your hands were freed from the basket. 

###### 7 
In distress you called, and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah 

###### 8 
Hear, O my people, while I admonish you! O Israel, if you would but listen to me! 

###### 9 
There shall be no strange god among you; you shall not bow down to a foreign god. 

###### 10 
I am the LORD your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it. 

###### 11 
"But my people did not listen to my voice; Israel would not submit to me. 

###### 12 
So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts, to follow their own counsels. 

###### 13 
Oh, that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk in my ways! 

###### 14 
I would soon subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes. 

###### 15 
Those who hate the LORD would cringe toward him, and their fate would last forever. 

###### 16 
But he would feed you with the finest of the wheat, and with honey from the rock I would satisfy you." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
