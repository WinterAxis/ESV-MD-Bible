###### 1 
For God alone my soul waits in silence; from him comes my salvation. 

###### 2 
He alone is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be greatly shaken. 

###### 3 
How long will all of you attack a man to batter him, like a leaning wall, a tottering fence? 

###### 4 
They only plan to thrust him down from his high position. They take pleasure in falsehood. They bless with their mouths, but inwardly they curse. Selah 

###### 5 
For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence, for my hope is from him. 

###### 6 
He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be shaken. 

###### 7 
On God rests my salvation and my glory; my mighty rock, my refuge is God. 

###### 8 
Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us. Selah 

###### 9 
Those of low estate are but a breath; those of high estate are a delusion; in the balances they go up; they are together lighter than a breath. 

###### 10 
Put no trust in extortion; set no vain hopes on robbery; if riches increase, set not your heart on them. 

###### 11 
Once God has spoken; twice have I heard this: that power belongs to God, 

###### 12 
and that to you, O Lord, belongs steadfast love. For you will render to a man according to his work. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
