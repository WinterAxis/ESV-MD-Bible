***

###### 1 
Do you indeed decree what is right, you gods? Do you judge the children of man uprightly? 

###### 2 
No, in your hearts you devise wrongs; your hands deal out violence on earth. 

###### 3 
The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from birth, speaking lies. 

###### 4 
They have venom like the venom of a serpent, like the deaf adder that stops its ear, 

###### 5 
so that it does not hear the voice of charmers or of the cunning enchanter. 

###### 6 
O God, break the teeth in their mouths; tear out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD! 

###### 7 
Let them vanish like water that runs away; when he aims his arrows, let them be blunted. 

###### 8 
Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime, like the stillborn child who never sees the sun. 

###### 9 
Sooner than your pots can feel the heat of thorns, whether green or ablaze, may he sweep them away! 

###### 10 
The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked. 

###### 11 
Mankind will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous; surely there is a God who judges on earth."
