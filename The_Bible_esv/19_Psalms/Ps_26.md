###### 1 
Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have walked in my integrity, and I have trusted in the LORD without wavering. 

###### 2 
Prove me, O LORD, and try me; test my heart and my mind. 

###### 3 
For your steadfast love is before my eyes, and I walk in your faithfulness. 

###### 4 
I do not sit with men of falsehood, nor do I consort with hypocrites. 

###### 5 
I hate the assembly of evildoers, and I will not sit with the wicked. 

###### 6 
I wash my hands in innocence and go around your altar, O LORD, 

###### 7 
proclaiming thanksgiving aloud, and telling all your wondrous deeds. 

###### 8 
O LORD, I love the habitation of your house and the place where your glory dwells. 

###### 9 
Do not sweep my soul away with sinners, nor my life with bloodthirsty men, 

###### 10 
in whose hands are evil devices, and whose right hands are full of bribes. 

###### 11 
But as for me, I shall walk in my integrity; redeem me, and be gracious to me. 

###### 12 
My foot stands on level ground; in the great assembly I will bless the LORD.
