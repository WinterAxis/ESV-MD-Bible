###### 1 
Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever! 

###### 2 
Let Israel say, "His steadfast love endures forever." 

###### 3 
Let the house of Aaron say, "His steadfast love endures forever." 

###### 4 
Let those who fear the LORD say, "His steadfast love endures forever." 

###### 5 
Out of my distress I called on the LORD; the LORD answered me and set me free. 

###### 6 
The LORD is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me? 

###### 7 
The LORD is on my side as my helper; I shall look in triumph on those who hate me. 

###### 8 
It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man. 

###### 9 
It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes. 

###### 10 
All nations surrounded me; in the name of the LORD I cut them off! 

###### 11 
They surrounded me, surrounded me on every side; in the name of the LORD I cut them off! 

###### 12 
They surrounded me like bees; they went out like a fire among thorns; in the name of the LORD I cut them off! 

###### 13 
I was pushed hard, so that I was falling, but the LORD helped me. 

###### 14 
The LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation. 

###### 15 
Glad songs of salvation are in the tents of the righteous: "The right hand of the LORD does valiantly, 

###### 16 
the right hand of the LORD exalts, the right hand of the LORD does valiantly!" 

###### 17 
I shall not die, but I shall live, and recount the deeds of the LORD. 

###### 18 
The LORD has disciplined me severely, but he has not given me over to death. 

###### 19 
Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter through them and give thanks to the LORD. 

###### 20 
This is the gate of the LORD; the righteous shall enter through it. 

###### 21 
I thank you that you have answered me and have become my salvation. 

###### 22 
The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. 

###### 23 
This is the LORD's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes. 

###### 24 
This is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it. 

###### 25 
Save us, we pray, O LORD! O LORD, we pray, give us success! 

###### 26 
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD! We bless you from the house of the LORD. 

###### 27 
The LORD is God, and he has made his light to shine upon us. Bind the festal sacrifice with cords, up to the horns of the altar! 

###### 28 
You are my God, and I will give thanks to you; you are my God; I will extol you. 

###### 29 
Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
