***

###### 1 
O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath. 

###### 2 
Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am languishing; heal me, O LORD, for my bones are troubled. 

###### 3 
My soul also is greatly troubled. But you, O LORD--how long? 

###### 4 
Turn, O LORD, deliver my life; save me for the sake of your steadfast love. 

###### 5 
For in death there is no remembrance of you; in Sheol who will give you praise? 

###### 6 
I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping. 

###### 7 
My eye wastes away because of grief; it grows weak because of all my foes. 

###### 8 
Depart from me, all you workers of evil, for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping. 

###### 9 
The LORD has heard my plea; the LORD accepts my prayer. 

###### 10 
All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled; they shall turn back and be put to shame in a moment.
