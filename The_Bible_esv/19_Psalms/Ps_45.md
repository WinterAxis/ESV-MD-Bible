###### 1 
My heart overflows with a pleasing theme; I address my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe. 

###### 2 
You are the most handsome of the sons of men; grace is poured upon your lips; therefore God has blessed you forever. 

###### 3 
Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, in your splendor and majesty! 

###### 4 
In your majesty ride out victoriously for the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness; let your right hand teach you awesome deeds! 

###### 5 
Your arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; the peoples fall under you. 

###### 6 
Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness; 

###### 7 
you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions; 

###### 8 
your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia. From ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad; 

###### 9 
daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir. 

###### 10 
Hear, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear: forget your people and your father's house, 

###### 11 
and the king will desire your beauty. Since he is your lord, bow to him. 

###### 12 
The people of Tyre will seek your favor with gifts, the richest of the people. 

###### 13 
All glorious is the princess in her chamber, with robes interwoven with gold. 

###### 14 
In many-colored robes she is led to the king, with her virgin companions following behind her. 

###### 15 
With joy and gladness they are led along as they enter the palace of the king. 

###### 16 
In place of your fathers shall be your sons; you will make them princes in all the earth. 

###### 17 
I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore nations will praise you forever and ever.
