###### 1 
O LORD, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth! 

###### 2 
Rise up, O judge of the earth; repay to the proud what they deserve! 

###### 3 
O LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked exult? 

###### 4 
They pour out their arrogant words; all the evildoers boast. 

###### 5 
They crush your people, O LORD, and afflict your heritage. 

###### 6 
They kill the widow and the sojourner, and murder the fatherless; 

###### 7 
and they say, "The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive." 

###### 8 
Understand, O dullest of the people! Fools, when will you be wise? 

###### 9 
He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see? 

###### 10 
He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke? He who teaches man knowledge-- 

###### 11 
the LORD--knows the thoughts of man, that they are but a breath. 

###### 12 
Blessed is the man whom you discipline, O LORD, and whom you teach out of your law, 

###### 13 
to give him rest from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked. 

###### 14 
For the LORD will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage; 

###### 15 
for justice will return to the righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it. 

###### 16 
Who rises up for me against the wicked? Who stands up for me against evildoers? 

###### 17 
If the LORD had not been my help, my soul would soon have lived in the land of silence. 

###### 18 
When I thought, "My foot slips," your steadfast love, O LORD, held me up. 

###### 19 
When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul. 

###### 20 
Can wicked rulers be allied with you, those who frame injustice by statute? 

###### 21 
They band together against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent to death. 

###### 22 
But the LORD has become my stronghold, and my God the rock of my refuge. 

###### 23 
He will bring back on them their iniquity and wipe them out for their wickedness; the LORD our God will wipe them out. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
