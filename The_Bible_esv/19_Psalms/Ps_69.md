###### 1 
Save me, O God! For the waters have come up to my neck. 

###### 2 
I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold; I have come into deep waters, and the flood sweeps over me. 

###### 3 
I am weary with my crying out; my throat is parched. My eyes grow dim with waiting for my God. 

###### 4 
More in number than the hairs of my head are those who hate me without cause; mighty are those who would destroy me, those who attack me with lies. What I did not steal must I now restore? 

###### 5 
O God, you know my folly; the wrongs I have done are not hidden from you. 

###### 6 
Let not those who hope in you be put to shame through me, O Lord God of hosts; let not those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel. 

###### 7 
For it is for your sake that I have borne reproach, that dishonor has covered my face. 

###### 8 
I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother's sons. 

###### 9 
For zeal for your house has consumed me, and the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me. 

###### 10 
When I wept and humbled my soul with fasting, it became my reproach. 

###### 11 
When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them. 

###### 12 
I am the talk of those who sit in the gate, and the drunkards make songs about me. 

###### 13 
But as for me, my prayer is to you, O LORD. At an acceptable time, O God, in the abundance of your steadfast love answer me in your saving faithfulness. 

###### 14 
Deliver me from sinking in the mire; let me be delivered from my enemies and from the deep waters. 

###### 15 
Let not the flood sweep over me, or the deep swallow me up, or the pit close its mouth over me. 

###### 16 
Answer me, O LORD, for your steadfast love is good; according to your abundant mercy, turn to me. 

###### 17 
Hide not your face from your servant, for I am in distress; make haste to answer me. 

###### 18 
Draw near to my soul, redeem me; ransom me because of my enemies! 

###### 19 
You know my reproach, and my shame and my dishonor; my foes are all known to you. 

###### 20 
Reproaches have broken my heart, so that I am in despair. I looked for pity, but there was none, and for comforters, but I found none. 

###### 21 
They gave me poison for food, and for my thirst they gave me sour wine to drink. 

###### 22 
Let their own table before them become a snare; and when they are at peace, let it become a trap. 

###### 23 
Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see, and make their loins tremble continually. 

###### 24 
Pour out your indignation upon them, and let your burning anger overtake them. 

###### 25 
May their camp be a desolation; let no one dwell in their tents. 

###### 26 
For they persecute him whom you have struck down, and they recount the pain of those you have wounded. 

###### 27 
Add to them punishment upon punishment; may they have no acquittal from you. 

###### 28 
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; let them not be enrolled among the righteous. 

###### 29 
But I am afflicted and in pain; let your salvation, O God, set me on high! 

###### 30 
I will praise the name of God with a song; I will magnify him with thanksgiving. 

###### 31 
This will please the LORD more than an ox or a bull with horns and hoofs. 

###### 32 
When the humble see it they will be glad; you who seek God, let your hearts revive. 

###### 33 
For the LORD hears the needy and does not despise his own people who are prisoners. 

###### 34 
Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and everything that moves in them. 

###### 35 
For God will save Zion and build up the cities of Judah, and people shall dwell there and possess it; 

###### 36 
the offspring of his servants shall inherit it, and those who love his name shall dwell in it. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
