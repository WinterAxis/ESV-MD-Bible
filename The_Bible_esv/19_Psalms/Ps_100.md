###### 1 
Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth! 

###### 2 
Serve the LORD with gladness! Come into his presence with singing! 

###### 3 
Know that the LORD, he is God! It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 

###### 4 
Enter his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with praise! Give thanks to him; bless his name! 

###### 5 
For the LORD is good; his steadfast love endures forever, and his faithfulness to all generations. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
