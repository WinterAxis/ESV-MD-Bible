###### 1 
Blessed is everyone who fears the LORD, who walks in his ways! 

###### 2 
You shall eat the fruit of the labor of your hands; you shall be blessed, and it shall be well with you. 

###### 3 
Your wife will be like a fruitful vine within your house; your children will be like olive shoots around your table. 

###### 4 
Behold, thus shall the man be blessed who fears the LORD. 

###### 5 
The LORD bless you from Zion! May you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life! 

###### 6 
May you see your children's children! Peace be upon Israel!
