###### 1 
I will sing of the steadfast love of the LORD, forever; with my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations. 

###### 2 
For I said, "Steadfast love will be built up forever; in the heavens you will establish your faithfulness." 

###### 3 
You have said, "I have made a covenant with my chosen one; I have sworn to David my servant: 

###### 4 
'I will establish your offspring forever, and build your throne for all generations.'" Selah 

###### 5 
Let the heavens praise your wonders, O LORD, your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones! 

###### 6 
For who in the skies can be compared to the LORD? Who among the heavenly beings is like the LORD, 

###### 7 
a God greatly to be feared in the council of the holy ones, and awesome above all who are around him? 

###### 8 
O LORD God of hosts, who is mighty as you are, O LORD, with your faithfulness all around you? 

###### 9 
You rule the raging of the sea; when its waves rise, you still them. 

###### 10 
You crushed Rahab like a carcass; you scattered your enemies with your mighty arm. 

###### 11 
The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours; the world and all that is in it, you have founded them. 

###### 12 
The north and the south, you have created them; Tabor and Hermon joyously praise your name. 

###### 13 
You have a mighty arm; strong is your hand, high your right hand. 

###### 14 
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; steadfast love and faithfulness go before you. 

###### 15 
Blessed are the people who know the festal shout, who walk, O LORD, in the light of your face, 

###### 16 
who exult in your name all the day and in your righteousness are exalted. 

###### 17 
For you are the glory of their strength; by your favor our horn is exalted. 

###### 18 
For our shield belongs to the LORD, our king to the Holy One of Israel. 

###### 19 
Of old you spoke in a vision to your godly one, and said: "I have granted help to one who is mighty; I have exalted one chosen from the people. 

###### 20 
I have found David, my servant; with my holy oil I have anointed him, 

###### 21 
so that my hand shall be established with him; my arm also shall strengthen him. 

###### 22 
The enemy shall not outwit him; the wicked shall not humble him. 

###### 23 
I will crush his foes before him and strike down those who hate him. 

###### 24 
My faithfulness and my steadfast love shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted. 

###### 25 
I will set his hand on the sea and his right hand on the rivers. 

###### 26 
He shall cry to me, 'You are my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.' 

###### 27 
And I will make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth. 

###### 28 
My steadfast love I will keep for him forever, and my covenant will stand firm for him. 

###### 29 
I will establish his offspring forever and his throne as the days of the heavens. 

###### 30 
If his children forsake my law and do not walk according to my rules, 

###### 31 
if they violate my statutes and do not keep my commandments, 

###### 32 
then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes, 

###### 33 
but I will not remove from him my steadfast love or be false to my faithfulness. 

###### 34 
I will not violate my covenant or alter the word that went forth from my lips. 

###### 35 
Once for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David. 

###### 36 
His offspring shall endure forever, his throne as long as the sun before me. 

###### 37 
Like the moon it shall be established forever, a faithful witness in the skies." Selah 

###### 38 
But now you have cast off and rejected; you are full of wrath against your anointed. 

###### 39 
You have renounced the covenant with your servant; you have defiled his crown in the dust. 

###### 40 
You have breached all his walls; you have laid his strongholds in ruins. 

###### 41 
All who pass by plunder him; he has become the scorn of his neighbors. 

###### 42 
You have exalted the right hand of his foes; you have made all his enemies rejoice. 

###### 43 
You have also turned back the edge of his sword, and you have not made him stand in battle. 

###### 44 
You have made his splendor to cease and cast his throne to the ground. 

###### 45 
You have cut short the days of his youth; you have covered him with shame. Selah 

###### 46 
How long, O LORD? Will you hide yourself forever? How long will your wrath burn like fire? 

###### 47 
Remember how short my time is! For what vanity you have created all the children of man! 

###### 48 
What man can live and never see death? Who can deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah 

###### 49 
Lord, where is your steadfast love of old, which by your faithfulness you swore to David? 

###### 50 
Remember, O Lord, how your servants are mocked, and how I bear in my heart the insults of all the many nations, 

###### 51 
with which your enemies mock, O LORD, with which they mock the footsteps of your anointed. 

###### 52 
Blessed be the LORD forever! Amen and Amen.
