###### 1 
My heart is steadfast, O God! I will sing and make melody with all my being! 

###### 2 
Awake, O harp and lyre! I will awake the dawn! 

###### 3 
I will give thanks to you, O LORD, among the peoples; I will sing praises to you among the nations. 

###### 4 
For your steadfast love is great above the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the clouds. 

###### 5 
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens! Let your glory be over all the earth! 

###### 6 
That your beloved ones may be delivered, give salvation by your right hand and answer me! 

###### 7 
God has promised in his holiness: "With exultation I will divide up Shechem and portion out the Valley of Succoth. 

###### 8 
Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my scepter. 

###### 9 
Moab is my washbasin; upon Edom I cast my shoe; over Philistia I shout in triumph." 

###### 10 
Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 

###### 11 
Have you not rejected us, O God? You do not go out, O God, with our armies. 

###### 12 
Oh grant us help against the foe, for vain is the salvation of man! 

###### 13 
With God we shall do valiantly; it is he who will tread down our foes.
