###### 1 
The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork. 

###### 2 
Day to day pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge. 

###### 3 
There is no speech, nor are there words, whose voice is not heard. 

###### 4 
Their voice goes out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun, 

###### 5 
which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy. 

###### 6 
Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the end of them, and there is nothing hidden from its heat. 

###### 7 
The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple; 

###### 8 
the precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes; 

###### 9 
the fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the rules of the LORD are true, and righteous altogether. 

###### 10 
More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb. 

###### 11 
Moreover, by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward. 

###### 12 
Who can discern his errors? Declare me innocent from hidden faults. 

###### 13 
Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me! Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression. 

###### 14 
Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O LORD, my rock and my redeemer.
