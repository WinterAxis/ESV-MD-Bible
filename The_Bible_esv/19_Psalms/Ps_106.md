###### 1 
Praise the LORD! Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever! 

###### 2 
Who can utter the mighty deeds of the LORD, or declare all his praise? 

###### 3 
Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times! 

###### 4 
Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people; help me when you save them, 

###### 5 
that I may look upon the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance. 

###### 6 
Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have committed iniquity; we have done wickedness. 

###### 7 
Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider your wondrous works; they did not remember the abundance of your steadfast love, but rebelled by the sea, at the Red Sea. 

###### 8 
Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make known his mighty power. 

###### 9 
He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry, and he led them through the deep as through a desert. 

###### 10 
So he saved them from the hand of the foe and redeemed them from the power of the enemy. 

###### 11 
And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left. 

###### 12 
Then they believed his words; they sang his praise. 

###### 13 
But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel. 

###### 14 
But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert; 

###### 15 
he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them. 

###### 16 
When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD, 

###### 17 
the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. 

###### 18 
Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. 

###### 19 
They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a metal image. 

###### 20 
They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass. 

###### 21 
They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt, 

###### 22 
wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome deeds by the Red Sea. 

###### 23 
Therefore he said he would destroy them-- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them. 

###### 24 
Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise. 

###### 25 
They murmured in their tents, and did not obey the voice of the LORD. 

###### 26 
Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness, 

###### 27 
and would make their offspring fall among the nations, scattering them among the lands. 

###### 28 
Then they yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead; 

###### 29 
they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds, and a plague broke out among them. 

###### 30 
Then Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was stayed. 

###### 31 
And that was counted to him as righteousness from generation to generation forever. 

###### 32 
They angered him at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account, 

###### 33 
for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke rashly with his lips. 

###### 34 
They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them, 

###### 35 
but they mixed with the nations and learned to do as they did. 

###### 36 
They served their idols, which became a snare to them. 

###### 37 
They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons; 

###### 38 
they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was polluted with blood. 

###### 39 
Thus they became unclean by their acts, and played the whore in their deeds. 

###### 40 
Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his heritage; 

###### 41 
he gave them into the hand of the nations, so that those who hated them ruled over them. 

###### 42 
Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their power. 

###### 43 
Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their purposes and were brought low through their iniquity. 

###### 44 
Nevertheless, he looked upon their distress, when he heard their cry. 

###### 45 
For their sake he remembered his covenant, and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love. 

###### 46 
He caused them to be pitied by all those who held them captive. 

###### 47 
Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise. 

###### 48 
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! And let all the people say, "Amen!" Praise the LORD!
