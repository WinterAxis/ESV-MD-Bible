###### 1 
Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name give glory, for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness! 

###### 2 
Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" 

###### 3 
Our God is in the heavens; he does all that he pleases. 

###### 4 
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands. 

###### 5 
They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see. 

###### 6 
They have ears, but do not hear; noses, but do not smell. 

###### 7 
They have hands, but do not feel; feet, but do not walk; and they do not make a sound in their throat. 

###### 8 
Those who make them become like them; so do all who trust in them. 

###### 9 
O Israel, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield. 

###### 10 
O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield. 

###### 11 
You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! He is their help and their shield. 

###### 12 
The LORD has remembered us; he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron; 

###### 13 
he will bless those who fear the LORD, both the small and the great. 

###### 14 
May the LORD give you increase, you and your children! 

###### 15 
May you be blessed by the LORD, who made heaven and earth! 

###### 16 
The heavens are the LORD's heavens, but the earth he has given to the children of man. 

###### 17 
The dead do not praise the LORD, nor do any who go down into silence. 

###### 18 
But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and forevermore. Praise the LORD!
