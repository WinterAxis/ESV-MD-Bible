###### 1 
Praise the LORD! For it is good to sing praises to our God; for it is pleasant, and a song of praise is fitting. 

###### 2 
The LORD builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the outcasts of Israel. 

###### 3 
He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds. 

###### 4 
He determines the number of the stars; he gives to all of them their names. 

###### 5 
Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure. 

###### 6 
The LORD lifts up the humble; he casts the wicked to the ground. 

###### 7 
Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; make melody to our God on the lyre! 

###### 8 
He covers the heavens with clouds; he prepares rain for the earth; he makes grass grow on the hills. 

###### 9 
He gives to the beasts their food, and to the young ravens that cry. 

###### 10 
His delight is not in the strength of the horse, nor his pleasure in the legs of a man, 

###### 11 
but the LORD takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in his steadfast love. 

###### 12 
Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem! Praise your God, O Zion! 

###### 13 
For he strengthens the bars of your gates; he blesses your children within you. 

###### 14 
He makes peace in your borders; he fills you with the finest of the wheat. 

###### 15 
He sends out his command to the earth; his word runs swiftly. 

###### 16 
He gives snow like wool; he scatters frost like ashes. 

###### 17 
He hurls down his crystals of ice like crumbs; who can stand before his cold? 

###### 18 
He sends out his word, and melts them; he makes his wind blow and the waters flow. 

###### 19 
He declares his word to Jacob, his statutes and rules to Israel. 

###### 20 
He has not dealt thus with any other nation; they do not know his rules. Praise the LORD!
