###### 1 
I will bless the LORD at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth. 

###### 2 
My soul makes its boast in the LORD; let the humble hear and be glad. 

###### 3 
Oh, magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together! 

###### 4 
I sought the LORD, and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears. 

###### 5 
Those who look to him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed. 

###### 6 
This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him and saved him out of all his troubles. 

###### 7 
The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear him, and delivers them. 

###### 8 
Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good! Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him! 

###### 9 
Oh, fear the LORD, you his saints, for those who fear him have no lack! 

###### 10 
The young lions suffer want and hunger; but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing. 

###### 11 
Come, O children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD. 

###### 12 
What man is there who desires life and loves many days, that he may see good? 

###### 13 
Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from speaking deceit. 

###### 14 
Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it. 

###### 15 
The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous and his ears toward their cry. 

###### 16 
The face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth. 

###### 17 
When the righteous cry for help, the LORD hears and delivers them out of all their troubles. 

###### 18 
The LORD is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit. 

###### 19 
Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him out of them all. 

###### 20 
He keeps all his bones; not one of them is broken. 

###### 21 
Affliction will slay the wicked, and those who hate the righteous will be condemned. 

###### 22 
The LORD redeems the life of his servants; none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned.
