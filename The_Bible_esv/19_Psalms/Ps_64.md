###### 1 
Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; preserve my life from dread of the enemy. 

###### 2 
Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked, from the throng of evildoers, 

###### 3 
who whet their tongues like swords, who aim bitter words like arrows, 

###### 4 
shooting from ambush at the blameless, shooting at him suddenly and without fear. 

###### 5 
They hold fast to their evil purpose; they talk of laying snares secretly, thinking, "Who can see them?" 

###### 6 
They search out injustice, saying, "We have accomplished a diligent search." For the inward mind and heart of a man are deep. 

###### 7 
But God shoots his arrow at them; they are wounded suddenly. 

###### 8 
They are brought to ruin, with their own tongues turned against them; all who see them will wag their heads. 

###### 9 
Then all mankind fears; they tell what God has brought about and ponder what he has done. 

###### 10 
Let the righteous one rejoice in the LORD and take refuge in him! Let all the upright in heart exult! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
