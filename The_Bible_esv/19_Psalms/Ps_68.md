###### 1 
God shall arise, his enemies shall be scattered; and those who hate him shall flee before him! 

###### 2 
As smoke is driven away, so you shall drive them away; as wax melts before fire, so the wicked shall perish before God! 

###### 3 
But the righteous shall be glad; they shall exult before God; they shall be jubilant with joy! 

###### 4 
Sing to God, sing praises to his name; lift up a song to him who rides through the deserts; his name is the LORD; exult before him! 

###### 5 
Father of the fatherless and protector of widows is God in his holy habitation. 

###### 6 
God settles the solitary in a home; he leads out the prisoners to prosperity, but the rebellious dwell in a parched land. 

###### 7 
O God, when you went out before your people, when you marched through the wilderness, Selah 

###### 8 
the earth quaked, the heavens poured down rain, before God, the One of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel. 

###### 9 
Rain in abundance, O God, you shed abroad; you restored your inheritance as it languished; 

###### 10 
your flock found a dwelling in it; in your goodness, O God, you provided for the needy. 

###### 11 
The Lord gives the word; the women who announce the news are a great host: 

###### 12 
"The kings of the armies--they flee, they flee!" The women at home divide the spoil-- 

###### 13 
though you men lie among the sheepfolds-- the wings of a dove covered with silver, its pinions with shimmering gold. 

###### 14 
When the Almighty scatters kings there, let snow fall on Zalmon. 

###### 15 
O mountain of God, mountain of Bashan; O many-peaked mountain, mountain of Bashan! 

###### 16 
Why do you look with hatred, O many-peaked mountain, at the mount that God desired for his abode, yes, where the LORD will dwell forever? 

###### 17 
The chariots of God are twice ten thousand, thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them; Sinai is now in the sanctuary. 

###### 18 
You ascended on high, leading a host of captives in your train and receiving gifts among men, even among the rebellious, that the LORD God may dwell there. 

###### 19 
Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears us up; God is our salvation. Selah 

###### 20 
Our God is a God of salvation, and to God, the Lord, belong deliverances from death. 

###### 21 
But God will strike the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of him who walks in his guilty ways. 

###### 22 
The Lord said, "I will bring them back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea, 

###### 23 
that you may strike your feet in their blood, that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from the foe." 

###### 24 
Your procession is seen, O God, the procession of my God, my King, into the sanctuary-- 

###### 25 
the singers in front, the musicians last, between them virgins playing tambourines: 

###### 26 
"Bless God in the great congregation, the LORD, O you who are of Israel's fountain!" 

###### 27 
There is Benjamin, the least of them, in the lead, the princes of Judah in their throng, the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali. 

###### 28 
Summon your power, O God, the power, O God, by which you have worked for us. 

###### 29 
Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings shall bear gifts to you. 

###### 30 
Rebuke the beasts that dwell among the reeds, the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples. Trample underfoot those who lust after tribute; scatter the peoples who delight in war. 

###### 31 
Nobles shall come from Egypt; Cush shall hasten to stretch out her hands to God. 

###### 32 
O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God; sing praises to the Lord, Selah 

###### 33 
to him who rides in the heavens, the ancient heavens; behold, he sends out his voice, his mighty voice. 

###### 34 
Ascribe power to God, whose majesty is over Israel, and whose power is in the skies. 

###### 35 
Awesome is God from his sanctuary; the God of Israel--he is the one who gives power and strength to his people.
