###### 1 
How lovely is your dwelling place, O LORD of hosts! 

###### 2 
My soul longs, yes, faints for the courts of the LORD; my heart and flesh sing for joy to the living God. 

###### 3 
Even the sparrow finds a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, at your altars, O LORD of hosts, my King and my God. 

###### 4 
Blessed are those who dwell in your house, ever singing your praise! Selah 

###### 5 
Blessed are those whose strength is in you, in whose heart are the highways to Zion. 

###### 6 
As they go through the Valley of Baca they make it a place of springs; the early rain also covers it with pools. 

###### 7 
They go from strength to strength; each one appears before God in Zion. 

###### 8 
O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah 

###### 9 
Behold our shield, O God; look on the face of your anointed! 

###### 10 
For a day in your courts is better than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of wickedness. 

###### 11 
For the LORD God is a sun and shield; the LORD bestows favor and honor. No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly. 

###### 12 
O LORD of hosts, blessed is the one who trusts in you! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
