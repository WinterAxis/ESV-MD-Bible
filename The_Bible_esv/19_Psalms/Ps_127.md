***

###### 1 
Unless the LORD builds the house, those who build it labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the watchman stays awake in vain. 

###### 2 
It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest, eating the bread of anxious toil; for he gives to his beloved sleep. 

###### 3 
Behold, children are a heritage from the LORD, the fruit of the womb a reward. 

###### 4 
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of one's youth. 

###### 5 
Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them! He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate.
