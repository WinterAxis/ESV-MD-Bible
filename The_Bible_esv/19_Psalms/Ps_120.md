***

###### 1 
In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. 

###### 2 
Deliver me, O LORD, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue. 

###### 3 
What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done to you, you deceitful tongue? 

###### 4 
A warrior's sharp arrows, with glowing coals of the broom tree! 

###### 5 
Woe to me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar! 

###### 6 
Too long have I had my dwelling among those who hate peace. 

###### 7 
I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war!
