***

###### 1 
The LORD reigns; let the peoples tremble! He sits enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake! 

###### 2 
The LORD is great in Zion; he is exalted over all the peoples. 

###### 3 
Let them praise your great and awesome name! Holy is he! 

###### 4 
The King in his might loves justice. You have established equity; you have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob. 

###### 5 
Exalt the LORD our God; worship at his footstool! Holy is he! 

###### 6 
Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel also was among those who called upon his name. They called to the LORD, and he answered them. 

###### 7 
In the pillar of the cloud he spoke to them; they kept his testimonies and the statute that he gave them. 

###### 8 
O LORD our God, you answered them; you were a forgiving God to them, but an avenger of their wrongdoings. 

###### 9 
Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy mountain; for the LORD our God is holy!
