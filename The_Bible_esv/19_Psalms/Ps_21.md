###### 1 
O LORD, in your strength the king rejoices, and in your salvation how greatly he exults! 

###### 2 
You have given him his heart's desire and have not withheld the request of his lips. Selah 

###### 3 
For you meet him with rich blessings; you set a crown of fine gold upon his head. 

###### 4 
He asked life of you; you gave it to him, length of days forever and ever. 

###### 5 
His glory is great through your salvation; splendor and majesty you bestow on him. 

###### 6 
For you make him most blessed forever; you make him glad with the joy of your presence. 

###### 7 
For the king trusts in the LORD, and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved. 

###### 8 
Your hand will find out all your enemies; your right hand will find out those who hate you. 

###### 9 
You will make them as a blazing oven when you appear. The LORD will swallow them up in his wrath, and fire will consume them. 

###### 10 
You will destroy their descendants from the earth, and their offspring from among the children of man. 

###### 11 
Though they plan evil against you, though they devise mischief, they will not succeed. 

###### 12 
For you will put them to flight; you will aim at their faces with your bows. 

###### 13 
Be exalted, O LORD, in your strength! We will sing and praise your power.
