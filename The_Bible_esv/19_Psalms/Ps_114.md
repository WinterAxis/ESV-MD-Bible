***

###### 1 
When Israel went out from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language, 

###### 2 
Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. 

###### 3 
The sea looked and fled; Jordan turned back. 

###### 4 
The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs. 

###### 5 
What ails you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back? 

###### 6 
O mountains, that you skip like rams? O hills, like lambs? 

###### 7 
Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 

###### 8 
who turns the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of water.
