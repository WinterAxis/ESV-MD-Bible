###### 1 
Why, O LORD, do you stand far away? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble? 

###### 2 
In arrogance the wicked hotly pursue the poor; let them be caught in the schemes that they have devised. 

###### 3 
For the wicked boasts of the desires of his soul, and the one greedy for gain curses and renounces the LORD. 

###### 4 
In the pride of his face the wicked does not seek him; all his thoughts are, "There is no God." 

###### 5 
His ways prosper at all times; your judgments are on high, out of his sight; as for all his foes, he puffs at them. 

###### 6 
He says in his heart, "I shall not be moved; throughout all generations I shall not meet adversity." 

###### 7 
His mouth is filled with cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity. 

###### 8 
He sits in ambush in the villages; in hiding places he murders the innocent. His eyes stealthily watch for the helpless; 

###### 9 
he lurks in ambush like a lion in his thicket; he lurks that he may seize the poor; he seizes the poor when he draws him into his net. 

###### 10 
The helpless are crushed, sink down, and fall by his might. 

###### 11 
He says in his heart, "God has forgotten, he has hidden his face, he will never see it." 

###### 12 
Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up your hand; forget not the afflicted. 

###### 13 
Why does the wicked renounce God and say in his heart, "You will not call to account"? 

###### 14 
But you do see, for you note mischief and vexation, that you may take it into your hands; to you the helpless commits himself; you have been the helper of the fatherless. 

###### 15 
Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; call his wickedness to account till you find none. 

###### 16 
The LORD is king forever and ever; the nations perish from his land. 

###### 17 
O LORD, you hear the desire of the afflicted; you will strengthen their heart; you will incline your ear 

###### 18 
to do justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, so that man who is of the earth may strike terror no more. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
