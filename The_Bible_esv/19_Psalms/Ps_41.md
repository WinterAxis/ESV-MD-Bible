###### 1 
Blessed is the one who considers the poor! In the day of trouble the LORD delivers him; 

###### 2 
the LORD protects him and keeps him alive; he is called blessed in the land; you do not give him up to the will of his enemies. 

###### 3 
The LORD sustains him on his sickbed; in his illness you restore him to full health. 

###### 4 
As for me, I said, "O LORD, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against you!" 

###### 5 
My enemies say of me in malice, "When will he die, and his name perish?" 

###### 6 
And when one comes to see me, he utters empty words, while his heart gathers iniquity; when he goes out, he tells it abroad. 

###### 7 
All who hate me whisper together about me; they imagine the worst for me. 

###### 8 
They say, "A deadly thing is poured out on him; he will not rise again from where he lies." 

###### 9 
Even my close friend in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, has lifted his heel against me. 

###### 10 
But you, O LORD, be gracious to me, and raise me up, that I may repay them! 

###### 11 
By this I know that you delight in me: my enemy will not shout in triumph over me. 

###### 12 
But you have upheld me because of my integrity, and set me in your presence forever. 

###### 13 
Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting! Amen and Amen.
