###### 1 
I was glad when they said to me, "Let us go to the house of the LORD!" 

###### 2 
Our feet have been standing within your gates, O Jerusalem! 

###### 3 
Jerusalem--built as a city that is bound firmly together, 

###### 4 
to which the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, as was decreed for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD. 

###### 5 
There thrones for judgment were set, the thrones of the house of David. 

###### 6 
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem! "May they be secure who love you! 

###### 7 
Peace be within your walls and security within your towers!" 

###### 8 
For my brothers and companions' sake I will say, "Peace be within you!" 

###### 9 
For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your good. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
