###### 1 
Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised in the city of our God! His holy mountain, <sup class="versenum mid-line">2</sup>beautiful in elevation, is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great King. 

###### 3 
Within her citadels God has made himself known as a fortress. 

###### 4 
For behold, the kings assembled; they came on together. 

###### 5 
As soon as they saw it, they were astounded; they were in panic; they took to flight. 

###### 6 
Trembling took hold of them there, anguish as of a woman in labor. 

###### 7 
By the east wind you shattered the ships of Tarshish. 

###### 8 
As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God, which God will establish forever. Selah 

###### 9 
We have thought on your steadfast love, O God, in the midst of your temple. 

###### 10 
As your name, O God, so your praise reaches to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is filled with righteousness. 

###### 11 
Let Mount Zion be glad! Let the daughters of Judah rejoice because of your judgments! 

###### 12 
Walk about Zion, go around her, number her towers, 

###### 13 
consider well her ramparts, go through her citadels, that you may tell the next generation 

###### 14 
that this is God, our God forever and ever. He will guide us forever.
