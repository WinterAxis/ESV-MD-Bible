###### 19 
I am a sojourner on the earth; hide not your commandments from me! 

###### 20 
My soul is consumed with longing for your rules at all times. 

###### 21 
You rebuke the insolent, accursed ones, who wander from your commandments.

###### 38 
Confirm to your servant your promise, that you may be feared. 

###### 39 
Turn away the reproach that I dread, for your rules are good. 

###### 40 
Behold, I long for your precepts; in your righteousness give me life! 

###### 41 
Let your steadfast love come to me, O LORD, your salvation according to your promise; 

###### 42 
then shall I have an answer for him who taunts me, for I trust in your word. 

###### 43 
And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth, for my hope is in your rules. 

###### 44 
I will keep your law continually, forever and ever, 

###### 45 
and I shall walk in a wide place, for I have sought your precepts. 

###### 46 
I will also speak of your testimonies before kings and shall not be put to shame, 

###### 47 
for I find my delight in your commandments, which I love. 

###### 48 
I will lift up my hands toward your commandments, which I love, and I will meditate on your statutes. 

###### 49 
Remember your word to your servant, in which you have made me hope. 

###### 50 
This is my comfort in my affliction, that your promise gives me life. 

###### 51 
The insolent utterly deride me, but I do not turn away from your law. 

###### 52 
When I think of your rules from of old, I take comfort, O LORD. 

###### 53 
Hot indignation seizes me because of the wicked, who forsake your law. 

###### 54 
Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my sojourning. 

###### 55 
I remember your name in the night, O LORD, and keep your law. 

###### 56 
This blessing has fallen to me, that I have kept your precepts. 

###### 57 
The LORD is my portion; I promise to keep your words.

I entreat your favor with all my heart; be gracious to me according to your promise. 

###### 59 
When I think on my ways, I turn my feet to your testimonies; 

###### 60 
I hasten and do not delay to keep your commandments. 

###### 61 
Though the cords of the wicked ensnare me, I do not forget your law. 

###### 62 
At midnight I rise to praise you, because of your righteous rules. 

###### 63 
I am a companion of all who fear you, of those who keep your precepts. 

###### 64 
The earth, O LORD, is full of your steadfast love; teach me your statutes! 

###### 65 
You have dealt well with your servant, O LORD, according to your word.

###### 69 
The insolent smear me with lies, but with my whole heart I keep your precepts; 

###### 70 
their heart is unfeeling like fat, but I delight in your law. 

###### 71 
It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn your statutes. 

###### 72 
The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of gold and silver pieces. 

###### 73 
Your hands have made and fashioned me; give me understanding that I may learn your commandments. 

###### 74 
Those who fear you shall see me and rejoice, because I have hoped in your word. 

###### 75 
I know, O LORD, that your rules are righteous, and that in faithfulness you have afflicted me. 

###### 76 
Let your steadfast love comfort me according to your promise to your servant. 

###### 77 
Let your mercy come to me, that I may live; for your law is my delight. 

###### 78 
Let the insolent be put to shame, because they have wronged me with falsehood; as for me, I will meditate on your precepts. 

###### 79 
Let those who fear you turn to me, that they may know your testimonies. 

###### 80 
May my heart be blameless in your statutes, that I may not be put to shame! 

###### 81 
My soul longs for your salvation; I hope in your word. 

###### 82 
My eyes long for your promise; I ask, "When will you comfort me?" 

###### 83 
For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, yet I have not forgotten your statutes. 

###### 84 
How long must your servant endure? When will you judge those who persecute me? 

###### 85 
The insolent have dug pitfalls for me; they do not live according to your law. 

###### 86 
All your commandments are sure; they persecute me with falsehood; help me! 

###### 87 
They have almost made an end of me on earth, but I have not forsaken your precepts. 

###### 88 
In your steadfast love give me life, that I may keep the testimonies of your mouth. 

###### 89 
Forever, O LORD, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens. 

###### 90 
Your faithfulness endures to all generations; you have established the earth, and it stands fast. 

###### 91 
By your appointment they stand this day, for all things are your servants. 

###### 92 
If your law had not been my delight, I would have perished in my affliction. 

###### 93 
I will never forget your precepts, for by them you have given me life. 

###### 94 
I am yours; save me, for I have sought your precepts. 

###### 95 
The wicked lie in wait to destroy me, but I consider your testimonies. 

###### 96 
I have seen a limit to all perfection, but your commandment is exceedingly broad. 

###### 97 
Oh how I love your law! It is my meditation all the day. 

###### 98 
Your commandment makes me wiser than my enemies, for it is ever with me. 

###### 99 
I have more understanding than all my teachers, for your testimonies are my meditation. 

###### 100 
I understand more than the aged, for I keep your precepts. 

###### 101 
I hold back my feet from every evil way, in order to keep your word. 

###### 102 
I do not turn aside from your rules, for you have taught me. 

###### 103 
How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth! 

###### 104 
Through your precepts I get understanding; therefore I hate every false way. 

###### 105 
Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path. 

###### 106 
I have sworn an oath and confirmed it, to keep your righteous rules. 

###### 107 
I am severely afflicted; give me life, O LORD, according to your word! 

###### 108 
Accept my freewill offerings of praise, O LORD, and teach me your rules. 

###### 109 
I hold my life in my hand continually, but I do not forget your law.

You are my hiding place and my shield; I hope in your word. 

###### 115 
Depart from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commandments of my God. 

###### 116 
Uphold me according to your promise, that I may live, and let me not be put to shame in my hope! 

###### 117 
Hold me up, that I may be safe and have regard for your statutes continually! 

###### 118 
You spurn all who go astray from your statutes, for their cunning is in vain. 

###### 119 
All the wicked of the earth you discard like dross, therefore I love your testimonies. 

###### 120 
My flesh trembles for fear of you, and I am afraid of your judgments. 

###### 121 
I have done what is just and right; do not leave me to my oppressors. 

###### 122 
Give your servant a pledge of good; let not the insolent oppress me. 

###### 123 
My eyes long for your salvation and for the fulfillment of your righteous promise. 

###### 124 
Deal with your servant according to your steadfast love, and teach me your statutes. 

###### 125 
I am your servant; give me understanding, that I may know your testimonies! 

###### 126 
It is time for the LORD to act, for your law has been broken. 

###### 127 
Therefore I love your commandments above gold, above fine gold. 

###### 128 
Therefore I consider all your precepts to be right; I hate every false way.

The unfolding of your words gives light; it imparts understanding to the simple.

Turn to me and be gracious to me, as is your way with those who love your name. 

###### 133 
Keep steady my steps according to your promise, and let no iniquity get dominion over me. 

###### 134 
Redeem me from man's oppression, that I may keep your precepts. 

###### 135 
Make your face shine upon your servant, and teach me your statutes. 

###### 136 
My eyes shed streams of tears, because people do not keep your law. 

###### 137 
Righteous are you, O LORD, and right are your rules. 

###### 138 
You have appointed your testimonies in righteousness and in all faithfulness. 

###### 139 
My zeal consumes me, because my foes forget your words. 

###### 140 
Your promise is well tried, and your servant loves it. 

###### 141 
I am small and despised, yet I do not forget your precepts. 

###### 142 
Your righteousness is righteous forever, and your law is true. 

###### 143 
Trouble and anguish have found me out, but your commandments are my delight. 

###### 144 
Your testimonies are righteous forever; give me understanding that I may live. 

###### 145 
With my whole heart I cry; answer me, O LORD! I will keep your statutes.

###### 149 
Hear my voice according to your steadfast love; O LORD, according to your justice give me life.

They draw near who persecute me with evil purpose; they are far from your law. 

###### 151 
But you are near, O LORD, and all your commandments are true. 

###### 152 
Long have I known from your testimonies that you have founded them forever. 

###### 153 
Look on my affliction and deliver me, for I do not forget your law. 

###### 154 
Plead my cause and redeem me; give me life according to your promise! 

###### 155 
Salvation is far from the wicked, for they do not seek your statutes. 

###### 156 
Great is your mercy, O LORD; give me life according to your rules. 

###### 157 
Many are my persecutors and my adversaries, but I do not swerve from your testimonies. 

###### 158 
I look at the faithless with disgust, because they do not keep your commands. 

###### 159 
Consider how I love your precepts! Give me life according to your steadfast love. 

###### 160 
The sum of your word is truth, and every one of your righteous rules endures forever. 

###### 161 
Princes persecute me without cause, but my heart stands in awe of your words. 

###### 162 
I rejoice at your word like one who finds great spoil. 

###### 163 
I hate and abhor falsehood, but I love your law. 

###### 164 
Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous rules. 

###### 165 
Great peace have those who love your law; nothing can make them stumble.

I keep your precepts and testimonies, for all my ways are before you. 

###### 169 
Let my cry come before you, O LORD; give me understanding according to your word! 

###### 170 
Let my plea come before you; deliver me according to your word. 

###### 171 
My lips will pour forth praise, for you teach me your statutes. 

###### 172 
My tongue will sing of your word, for all your commandments are right. 

###### 173 
Let your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts. 

###### 174 
I long for your salvation, O LORD, and your law is my delight.
