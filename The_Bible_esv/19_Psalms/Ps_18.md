###### 1 
I love you, O LORD, my strength. 

###### 2 
The LORD is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold. 

###### 3 
I call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised, and I am saved from my enemies. 

###### 4 
The cords of death encompassed me; the torrents of destruction assailed me; 

###### 5 
the cords of Sheol entangled me; the snares of death confronted me. 

###### 6 
In my distress I called upon the LORD; to my God I cried for help. From his temple he heard my voice, and my cry to him reached his ears. 

###### 7 
Then the earth reeled and rocked; the foundations also of the mountains trembled and quaked, because he was angry. 

###### 8 
Smoke went up from his nostrils, and devouring fire from his mouth; glowing coals flamed forth from him. 

###### 9 
He bowed the heavens and came down; thick darkness was under his feet. 

###### 10 
He rode on a cherub and flew; he came swiftly on the wings of the wind. 

###### 11 
He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him, thick clouds dark with water. 

###### 12 
Out of the brightness before him hailstones and coals of fire broke through his clouds. 

###### 13 
The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered his voice, hailstones and coals of fire. 

###### 14 
And he sent out his arrows and scattered them; he flashed forth lightnings and routed them. 

###### 15 
Then the channels of the sea were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of your nostrils. 

###### 16 
He sent from on high, he took me; he drew me out of many waters. 

###### 17 
He rescued me from my strong enemy and from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me. 

###### 18 
They confronted me in the day of my calamity, but the LORD was my support. 

###### 19 
He brought me out into a broad place; he rescued me, because he delighted in me. 

###### 20 
The LORD dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he rewarded me. 

###### 21 
For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. 

###### 22 
For all his rules were before me, and his statutes I did not put away from me. 

###### 23 
I was blameless before him, and I kept myself from my guilt. 

###### 24 
So the LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight. 

###### 25 
With the merciful you show yourself merciful; with the blameless man you show yourself blameless; 

###### 26 
with the purified you show yourself pure; and with the crooked you make yourself seem tortuous. 

###### 27 
For you save a humble people, but the haughty eyes you bring down. 

###### 28 
For it is you who light my lamp; the LORD my God lightens my darkness. 

###### 29 
For by you I can run against a troop, and by my God I can leap over a wall. 

###### 30 
This God--his way is perfect; the word of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him. 

###### 31 
For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?-- 

###### 32 
the God who equipped me with strength and made my way blameless. 

###### 33 
He made my feet like the feet of a deer and set me secure on the heights. 

###### 34 
He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze. 

###### 35 
You have given me the shield of your salvation, and your right hand supported me, and your gentleness made me great. 

###### 36 
You gave a wide place for my steps under me, and my feet did not slip. 

###### 37 
I pursued my enemies and overtook them, and did not turn back till they were consumed. 

###### 38 
I thrust them through, so that they were not able to rise; they fell under my feet. 

###### 39 
For you equipped me with strength for the battle; you made those who rise against me sink under me. 

###### 40 
You made my enemies turn their backs to me, and those who hated me I destroyed. 

###### 41 
They cried for help, but there was none to save; they cried to the LORD, but he did not answer them. 

###### 42 
I beat them fine as dust before the wind; I cast them out like the mire of the streets. 

###### 43 
You delivered me from strife with the people; you made me the head of the nations; people whom I had not known served me. 

###### 44 
As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me; foreigners came cringing to me. 

###### 45 
Foreigners lost heart and came trembling out of their fortresses. 

###### 46 
The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation-- 

###### 47 
the God who gave me vengeance and subdued peoples under me, 

###### 48 
who rescued me from my enemies; yes, you exalted me above those who rose against me; you delivered me from the man of violence. 

###### 49 
For this I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations, and sing to your name. 

###### 50 
Great salvation he brings to his king, and shows steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his offspring forever. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
