***

###### 1 
The LORD reigns; he is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed; he has put on strength as his belt. Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved. 

###### 2 
Your throne is established from of old; you are from everlasting. 

###### 3 
The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their roaring. 

###### 4 
Mightier than the thunders of many waters, mightier than the waves of the sea, the LORD on high is mighty! 

###### 5 
Your decrees are very trustworthy; holiness befits your house, O LORD, forevermore.
