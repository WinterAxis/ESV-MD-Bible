***

###### 1 
I will sing of steadfast love and justice; to you, O LORD, I will make music. 

###### 2 
I will ponder the way that is blameless. Oh when will you come to me? I will walk with integrity of heart within my house; 

###### 3 
I will not set before my eyes anything that is worthless. I hate the work of those who fall away; it shall not cling to me. 

###### 4 
A perverse heart shall be far from me; I will know nothing of evil. 

###### 5 
Whoever slanders his neighbor secretly I will destroy. Whoever has a haughty look and an arrogant heart I will not endure. 

###### 6 
I will look with favor on the faithful in the land, that they may dwell with me; he who walks in the way that is blameless shall minister to me. 

###### 7 
No one who practices deceit shall dwell in my house; no one who utters lies shall continue before my eyes. 

###### 8 
Morning by morning I will destroy all the wicked in the land, cutting off all the evildoers from the city of the LORD.
