###### 1 
O God, the nations have come into your inheritance; they have defiled your holy temple; they have laid Jerusalem in ruins. 

###### 2 
They have given the bodies of your servants to the birds of the heavens for food, the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the earth. 

###### 3 
They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them. 

###### 4 
We have become a taunt to our neighbors, mocked and derided by those around us. 

###### 5 
How long, O LORD? Will you be angry forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire? 

###### 6 
Pour out your anger on the nations that do not know you, and on the kingdoms that do not call upon your name! 

###### 7 
For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his habitation. 

###### 8 
Do not remember against us our former iniquities; let your compassion come speedily to meet us, for we are brought very low. 

###### 9 
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; deliver us, and atone for our sins, for your name's sake! 

###### 10 
Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let the avenging of the outpoured blood of your servants be known among the nations before our eyes! 

###### 11 
Let the groans of the prisoners come before you; according to your great power, preserve those doomed to die! 

###### 12 
Return sevenfold into the lap of our neighbors the taunts with which they have taunted you, O Lord! 

###### 13 
But we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise.
