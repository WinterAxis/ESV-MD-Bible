###### 1 
In the LORD I take refuge; how can you say to my soul, "Flee like a bird to your mountain, 

###### 2 
for behold, the wicked bend the bow; they have fitted their arrow to the string to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart; 

###### 3 
if the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?" 

###### 4 
The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD's throne is in heaven; his eyes see, his eyelids test the children of man. 

###### 5 
The LORD tests the righteous, but his soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence. 

###### 6 
Let him rain coals on the wicked; fire and sulfur and a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup. 

###### 7 
For the LORD is righteous; he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
