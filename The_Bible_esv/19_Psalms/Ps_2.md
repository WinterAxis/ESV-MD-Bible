###### 1 
Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain? 

###### 2 
The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and against his Anointed, saying, 

###### 3 
"Let us burst their bonds apart and cast away their cords from us." 

###### 4 
He who sits in the heavens laughs; the Lord holds them in derision. 

###### 5 
Then he will speak to them in his wrath, and terrify them in his fury, saying, 

###### 6 
"As for me, I have set my King on Zion, my holy hill." 

###### 7 
I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, "You are my Son; today I have begotten you. 

###### 8 
Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession. 

###### 9 
You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel." 

###### 10 
Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth. 

###### 11 
Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. 

###### 12 
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
