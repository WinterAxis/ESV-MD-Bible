###### 1 
Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, you who lead Joseph like a flock. You who are enthroned upon the cherubim, shine forth. 

###### 2 
Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might and come to save us! 

###### 3 
Restore us, O God; let your face shine, that we may be saved! 

###### 4 
O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry with your people's prayers? 

###### 5 
You have fed them with the bread of tears and given them tears to drink in full measure. 

###### 6 
You make us an object of contention for our neighbors, and our enemies laugh among themselves. 

###### 7 
Restore us, O God of hosts; let your face shine, that we may be saved! 

###### 8 
You brought a vine out of Egypt; you drove out the nations and planted it. 

###### 9 
You cleared the ground for it; it took deep root and filled the land. 

###### 10 
The mountains were covered with its shade, the mighty cedars with its branches. 

###### 11 
It sent out its branches to the sea and its shoots to the River. 

###### 12 
Why then have you broken down its walls, so that all who pass along the way pluck its fruit? 

###### 13 
The boar from the forest ravages it, and all that move in the field feed on it. 

###### 14 
Turn again, O God of hosts! Look down from heaven, and see; have regard for this vine, 

###### 15 
the stock that your right hand planted, and for the son whom you made strong for yourself. 

###### 16 
They have burned it with fire; they have cut it down; may they perish at the rebuke of your face! 

###### 17 
But let your hand be on the man of your right hand, the son of man whom you have made strong for yourself! 

###### 18 
Then we shall not turn back from you; give us life, and we will call upon your name! 

###### 19 
Restore us, O LORD God of hosts! Let your face shine, that we may be saved! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
