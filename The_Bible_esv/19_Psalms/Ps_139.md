###### 1 
O LORD, you have searched me and known me! 

###### 2 
You know when I sit down and when I rise up; you discern my thoughts from afar. 

###### 3 
You search out my path and my lying down and are acquainted with all my ways. 

###### 4 
Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, O LORD, you know it altogether. 

###### 5 
You hem me in, behind and before, and lay your hand upon me. 

###### 6 
Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high; I cannot attain it. 

###### 7 
Where shall I go from your Spirit? Or where shall I flee from your presence? 

###### 8 
If I ascend to heaven, you are there! If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there! 

###### 9 
If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, 

###### 10 
even there your hand shall lead me, and your right hand shall hold me. 

###### 11 
If I say, "Surely the darkness shall cover me, and the light about me be night," 

###### 12 
even the darkness is not dark to you; the night is bright as the day, for darkness is as light with you. 

###### 13 
For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb. 

###### 14 
I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well. 

###### 15 
My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. 

###### 16 
Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them. 

###### 17 
How precious to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them! 

###### 18 
If I would count them, they are more than the sand. I awake, and I am still with you. 

###### 19 
Oh that you would slay the wicked, O God! O men of blood, depart from me! 

###### 20 
They speak against you with malicious intent; your enemies take your name in vain. 

###### 21 
Do I not hate those who hate you, O LORD? And do I not loathe those who rise up against you? 

###### 22 
I hate them with complete hatred; I count them my enemies. 

###### 23 
Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! 

###### 24 
And see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!
