###### 1 
On the holy mount stands the city he founded; 

###### 2 
the LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob. 

###### 3 
Glorious things of you are spoken, O city of God. Selah 

###### 4 
Among those who know me I mention Rahab and Babylon; behold, Philistia and Tyre, with Cush-- "This one was born there," they say. 

###### 5 
And of Zion it shall be said, "This one and that one were born in her"; for the Most High himself will establish her. 

###### 6 
The LORD records as he registers the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah 

###### 7 
Singers and dancers alike say, "All my springs are in you." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
