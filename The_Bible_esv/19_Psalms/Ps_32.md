###### 1 
Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. 

###### 2 
Blessed is the man against whom the LORD counts no iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no deceit. 

###### 3 
For when I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. 

###### 4 
For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was dried up as by the heat of summer. Selah 

###### 5 
I acknowledged my sin to you, and I did not cover my iniquity; I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the LORD," and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah 

###### 6 
Therefore let everyone who is godly offer prayer to you at a time when you may be found; surely in the rush of great waters, they shall not reach him. 

###### 7 
You are a hiding place for me; you preserve me from trouble; you surround me with shouts of deliverance. Selah 

###### 8 
I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my eye upon you. 

###### 9 
Be not like a horse or a mule, without understanding, which must be curbed with bit and bridle, or it will not stay near you. 

###### 10 
Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but steadfast love surrounds the one who trusts in the LORD. 

###### 11 
Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, O righteous, and shout for joy, all you upright in heart!
