###### 1 
I cry aloud to God, aloud to God, and he will hear me. 

###### 2 
In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; in the night my hand is stretched out without wearying; my soul refuses to be comforted. 

###### 3 
When I remember God, I moan; when I meditate, my spirit faints. Selah 

###### 4 
You hold my eyelids open; I am so troubled that I cannot speak. 

###### 5 
I consider the days of old, the years long ago. 

###### 6 
I said, "Let me remember my song in the night; let me meditate in my heart." Then my spirit made a diligent search: 

###### 7 
"Will the Lord spurn forever, and never again be favorable? 

###### 8 
Has his steadfast love forever ceased? Are his promises at an end for all time? 

###### 9 
Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he in anger shut up his compassion?" Selah 

###### 10 
Then I said, "I will appeal to this, to the years of the right hand of the Most High." 

###### 11 
I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your wonders of old. 

###### 12 
I will ponder all your work, and meditate on your mighty deeds. 

###### 13 
Your way, O God, is holy. What god is great like our God? 

###### 14 
You are the God who works wonders; you have made known your might among the peoples. 

###### 15 
You with your arm redeemed your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. Selah 

###### 16 
When the waters saw you, O God, when the waters saw you, they were afraid; indeed, the deep trembled. 

###### 17 
The clouds poured out water; the skies gave forth thunder; your arrows flashed on every side. 

###### 18 
The crash of your thunder was in the whirlwind; your lightnings lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook. 

###### 19 
Your way was through the sea, your path through the great waters; yet your footprints were unseen. 

###### 20 
You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
