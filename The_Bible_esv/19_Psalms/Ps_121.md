###### 1 
I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come? 

###### 2 
My help comes from the LORD, who made heaven and earth. 

###### 3 
He will not let your foot be moved; he who keeps you will not slumber. 

###### 4 
Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep. 

###### 5 
The LORD is your keeper; the LORD is your shade on your right hand. 

###### 6 
The sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by night. 

###### 7 
The LORD will keep you from all evil; he will keep your life. 

###### 8 
The LORD will keep your going out and your coming in from this time forth and forevermore. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
