###### 1 
Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth! 

###### 2 
I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old, 

###### 3 
things that we have heard and known, that our fathers have told us. 

###### 4 
We will not hide them from their children, but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the LORD, and his might, and the wonders that he has done. 

###### 5 
He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers to teach to their children, 

###### 6 
that the next generation might know them, the children yet unborn, and arise and tell them to their children, 

###### 7 
so that they should set their hope in God and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments; 

###### 8 
and that they should not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast, whose spirit was not faithful to God. 

###### 9 
The Ephraimites, armed with the bow, turned back on the day of battle. 

###### 10 
They did not keep God's covenant, but refused to walk according to his law. 

###### 11 
They forgot his works and the wonders that he had shown them. 

###### 12 
In the sight of their fathers he performed wonders in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan. 

###### 13 
He divided the sea and let them pass through it, and made the waters stand like a heap. 

###### 14 
In the daytime he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a fiery light. 

###### 15 
He split rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink abundantly as from the deep. 

###### 16 
He made streams come out of the rock and caused waters to flow down like rivers. 

###### 17 
Yet they sinned still more against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert. 

###### 18 
They tested God in their heart by demanding the food they craved. 

###### 19 
They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the wilderness? 

###### 20 
He struck the rock so that water gushed out and streams overflowed. Can he also give bread or provide meat for his people?" 

###### 21 
Therefore, when the LORD heard, he was full of wrath; a fire was kindled against Jacob; his anger rose against Israel, 

###### 22 
because they did not believe in God and did not trust his saving power. 

###### 23 
Yet he commanded the skies above and opened the doors of heaven, 

###### 24 
and he rained down on them manna to eat and gave them the grain of heaven. 

###### 25 
Man ate of the bread of the angels; he sent them food in abundance. 

###### 26 
He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, and by his power he led out the south wind; 

###### 27 
he rained meat on them like dust, winged birds like the sand of the seas; 

###### 28 
he let them fall in the midst of their camp, all around their dwellings. 

###### 29 
And they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they craved. 

###### 30 
But before they had satisfied their craving, while the food was still in their mouths, 

###### 31 
the anger of God rose against them, and he killed the strongest of them and laid low the young men of Israel. 

###### 32 
In spite of all this, they still sinned; despite his wonders, they did not believe. 

###### 33 
So he made their days vanish like a breath, and their years in terror. 

###### 34 
When he killed them, they sought him; they repented and sought God earnestly. 

###### 35 
They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God their redeemer. 

###### 36 
But they flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues. 

###### 37 
Their heart was not steadfast toward him; they were not faithful to his covenant. 

###### 38 
Yet he, being compassionate, atoned for their iniquity and did not destroy them; he restrained his anger often and did not stir up all his wrath. 

###### 39 
He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and comes not again. 

###### 40 
How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved him in the desert! 

###### 41 
They tested God again and again and provoked the Holy One of Israel. 

###### 42 
They did not remember his power or the day when he redeemed them from the foe, 

###### 43 
when he performed his signs in Egypt and his marvels in the fields of Zoan. 

###### 44 
He turned their rivers to blood, so that they could not drink of their streams. 

###### 45 
He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them. 

###### 46 
He gave their crops to the destroying locust and the fruit of their labor to the locust. 

###### 47 
He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamores with frost. 

###### 48 
He gave over their cattle to the hail and their flocks to thunderbolts. 

###### 49 
He let loose on them his burning anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, a company of destroying angels. 

###### 50 
He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death, but gave their lives over to the plague. 

###### 51 
He struck down every firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham. 

###### 52 
Then he led out his people like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 

###### 53 
He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 

###### 54 
And he brought them to his holy land, to the mountain which his right hand had won. 

###### 55 
He drove out nations before them; he apportioned them for a possession and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents. 

###### 56 
Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God and did not keep his testimonies, 

###### 57 
but turned away and acted treacherously like their fathers; they twisted like a deceitful bow. 

###### 58 
For they provoked him to anger with their high places; they moved him to jealousy with their idols. 

###### 59 
When God heard, he was full of wrath, and he utterly rejected Israel. 

###### 60 
He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among mankind, 

###### 61 
and delivered his power to captivity, his glory to the hand of the foe. 

###### 62 
He gave his people over to the sword and vented his wrath on his heritage. 

###### 63 
Fire devoured their young men, and their young women had no marriage song. 

###### 64 
Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation. 

###### 65 
Then the Lord awoke as from sleep, like a strong man shouting because of wine. 

###### 66 
And he put his adversaries to rout; he put them to everlasting shame. 

###### 67 
He rejected the tent of Joseph; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim, 

###### 68 
but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion, which he loves. 

###### 69 
He built his sanctuary like the high heavens, like the earth, which he has founded forever. 

###### 70 
He chose David his servant and took him from the sheepfolds; 

###### 71 
from following the nursing ewes he brought him to shepherd Jacob his people, Israel his inheritance. 

###### 72 
With upright heart he shepherded them and guided them with his skillful hand. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
