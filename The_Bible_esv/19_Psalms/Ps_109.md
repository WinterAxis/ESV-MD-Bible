###### 1 
Be not silent, O God of my praise! 

###### 2 
For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me, speaking against me with lying tongues. 

###### 3 
They encircle me with words of hate, and attack me without cause. 

###### 4 
In return for my love they accuse me, but I give myself to prayer. 

###### 5 
So they reward me evil for good, and hatred for my love. 

###### 6 
Appoint a wicked man against him; let an accuser stand at his right hand. 

###### 7 
When he is tried, let him come forth guilty; let his prayer be counted as sin! 

###### 8 
May his days be few; may another take his office! 

###### 9 
May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow! 

###### 10 
May his children wander about and beg, seeking food far from the ruins they inhabit! 

###### 11 
May the creditor seize all that he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil! 

###### 12 
Let there be none to extend kindness to him, nor any to pity his fatherless children! 

###### 13 
May his posterity be cut off; may his name be blotted out in the second generation! 

###### 14 
May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out! 

###### 15 
Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth! 

###### 16 
For he did not remember to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy and the brokenhearted, to put them to death. 

###### 17 
He loved to curse; let curses come upon him! He did not delight in blessing; may it be far from him! 

###### 18 
He clothed himself with cursing as his coat; may it soak into his body like water, like oil into his bones! 

###### 19 
May it be like a garment that he wraps around him, like a belt that he puts on every day! 

###### 20 
May this be the reward of my accusers from the LORD, of those who speak evil against my life! 

###### 21 
But you, O God my Lord, deal on my behalf for your name's sake; because your steadfast love is good, deliver me! 

###### 22 
For I am poor and needy, and my heart is stricken within me. 

###### 23 
I am gone like a shadow at evening; I am shaken off like a locust. 

###### 24 
My knees are weak through fasting; my body has become gaunt, with no fat. 

###### 25 
I am an object of scorn to my accusers; when they see me, they wag their heads. 

###### 26 
Help me, O LORD my God! Save me according to your steadfast love! 

###### 27 
Let them know that this is your hand; you, O LORD, have done it! 

###### 28 
Let them curse, but you will bless! They arise and are put to shame, but your servant will be glad! 

###### 29 
May my accusers be clothed with dishonor; may they be wrapped in their own shame as in a cloak! 

###### 30 
With my mouth I will give great thanks to the LORD; I will praise him in the midst of the throng. 

###### 31 
For he stands at the right hand of the needy one, to save him from those who condemn his soul to death. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
