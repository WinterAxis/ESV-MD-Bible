###### 1 
Shout for joy in the LORD, O you righteous! Praise befits the upright. 

###### 2 
Give thanks to the LORD with the lyre; make melody to him with the harp of ten strings! 

###### 3 
Sing to him a new song; play skillfully on the strings, with loud shouts. 

###### 4 
For the word of the LORD is upright, and all his work is done in faithfulness. 

###### 5 
He loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of the steadfast love of the LORD. 

###### 6 
By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all their host. 

###### 7 
He gathers the waters of the sea as a heap; he puts the deeps in storehouses. 

###### 8 
Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him! 

###### 9 
For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm. 

###### 10 
The LORD brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; he frustrates the plans of the peoples. 

###### 11 
The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the plans of his heart to all generations. 

###### 12 
Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people whom he has chosen as his heritage! 

###### 13 
The LORD looks down from heaven; he sees all the children of man; 

###### 14 
from where he sits enthroned he looks out on all the inhabitants of the earth, 

###### 15 
he who fashions the hearts of them all and observes all their deeds. 

###### 16 
The king is not saved by his great army; a warrior is not delivered by his great strength. 

###### 17 
The war horse is a false hope for salvation, and by its great might it cannot rescue. 

###### 18 
Behold, the eye of the LORD is on those who fear him, on those who hope in his steadfast love, 

###### 19 
that he may deliver their soul from death and keep them alive in famine. 

###### 20 
Our soul waits for the LORD; he is our help and our shield. 

###### 21 
For our heart is glad in him, because we trust in his holy name. 

###### 22 
Let your steadfast love, O LORD, be upon us, even as we hope in you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
