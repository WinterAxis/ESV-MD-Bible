###### 1 
Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry come to you! 

###### 2 
Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress! Incline your ear to me; answer me speedily in the day when I call! 

###### 3 
For my days pass away like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace. 

###### 4 
My heart is struck down like grass and has withered; I forget to eat my bread. 

###### 5 
Because of my loud groaning my bones cling to my flesh. 

###### 6 
I am like a desert owl of the wilderness, like an owl of the waste places; 

###### 7 
I lie awake; I am like a lonely sparrow on the housetop. 

###### 8 
All the day my enemies taunt me; those who deride me use my name for a curse. 

###### 9 
For I eat ashes like bread and mingle tears with my drink, 

###### 10 
because of your indignation and anger; for you have taken me up and thrown me down. 

###### 11 
My days are like an evening shadow; I wither away like grass. 

###### 12 
But you, O LORD, are enthroned forever; you are remembered throughout all generations. 

###### 13 
You will arise and have pity on Zion; it is the time to favor her; the appointed time has come. 

###### 14 
For your servants hold her stones dear and have pity on her dust. 

###### 15 
Nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth will fear your glory. 

###### 16 
For the LORD builds up Zion; he appears in his glory; 

###### 17 
he regards the prayer of the destitute and does not despise their prayer. 

###### 18 
Let this be recorded for a generation to come, so that a people yet to be created may praise the LORD: 

###### 19 
that he looked down from his holy height; from heaven the LORD looked at the earth, 

###### 20 
to hear the groans of the prisoners, to set free those who were doomed to die, 

###### 21 
that they may declare in Zion the name of the LORD, and in Jerusalem his praise, 

###### 22 
when peoples gather together, and kingdoms, to worship the LORD. 

###### 23 
He has broken my strength in midcourse; he has shortened my days. 

###### 24 
"O my God," I say, "take me not away in the midst of my days-- you whose years endure throughout all generations!" 

###### 25 
Of old you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. 

###### 26 
They will perish, but you will remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You will change them like a robe, and they will pass away, 

###### 27 
but you are the same, and your years have no end. 

###### 28 
The children of your servants shall dwell secure; their offspring shall be established before you.
