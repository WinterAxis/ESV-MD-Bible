###### 1 
Hear a just cause, O LORD; attend to my cry! Give ear to my prayer from lips free of deceit! 

###### 2 
From your presence let my vindication come! Let your eyes behold the right! 

###### 3 
You have tried my heart, you have visited me by night, you have tested me, and you will find nothing; I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress. 

###### 4 
With regard to the works of man, by the word of your lips I have avoided the ways of the violent. 

###### 5 
My steps have held fast to your paths; my feet have not slipped. 

###### 6 
I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God; incline your ear to me; hear my words. 

###### 7 
Wondrously show your steadfast love, O Savior of those who seek refuge from their adversaries at your right hand. 

###### 8 
Keep me as the apple of your eye; hide me in the shadow of your wings, 

###### 9 
from the wicked who do me violence, my deadly enemies who surround me. 

###### 10 
They close their hearts to pity; with their mouths they speak arrogantly. 

###### 11 
They have now surrounded our steps; they set their eyes to cast us to the ground. 

###### 12 
He is like a lion eager to tear, as a young lion lurking in ambush. 

###### 13 
Arise, O LORD! Confront him, subdue him! Deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword, 

###### 14 
from men by your hand, O LORD, from men of the world whose portion is in this life. You fill their womb with treasure; they are satisfied with children, and they leave their abundance to their infants. 

###### 15 
As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
