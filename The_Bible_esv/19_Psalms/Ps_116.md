###### 1 
I love the LORD, because he has heard my voice and my pleas for mercy. 

###### 2 
Because he inclined his ear to me, therefore I will call on him as long as I live. 

###### 3 
The snares of death encompassed me; the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; I suffered distress and anguish. 

###### 4 
Then I called on the name of the LORD: "O LORD, I pray, deliver my soul!" 

###### 5 
Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; our God is merciful. 

###### 6 
The LORD preserves the simple; when I was brought low, he saved me. 

###### 7 
Return, O my soul, to your rest; for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you. 

###### 8 
For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling; 

###### 9 
I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 

###### 10 
I believed, even when I spoke: "I am greatly afflicted"; 

###### 11 
I said in my alarm, "All mankind are liars." 

###### 12 
What shall I render to the LORD for all his benefits to me? 

###### 13 
I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD, 

###### 14 
I will pay my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people. 

###### 15 
Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. 

###### 16 
O LORD, I am your servant; I am your servant, the son of your maidservant. You have loosed my bonds. 

###### 17 
I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the LORD. 

###### 18 
I will pay my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people, 

###### 19 
in the courts of the house of the LORD, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!
