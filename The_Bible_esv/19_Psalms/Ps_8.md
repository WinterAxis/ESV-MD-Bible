###### 1 
O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens. 

###### 2 
Out of the mouth of babies and infants, you have established strength because of your foes, to still the enemy and the avenger. 

###### 3 
When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, 

###### 4 
what is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him? 

###### 5 
Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor. 

###### 6 
You have given him dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet, 

###### 7 
all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field, 

###### 8 
the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes along the paths of the seas. 

###### 9 
O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
