###### 1 
The saying is trustworthy: If anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task. 

###### 2 
Therefore an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, 

###### 3 
not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. 

###### 4 
He must manage his own household well, with all dignity keeping his children submissive, 

###### 5 
for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's church? 

###### 6 
He must not be a recent convert, or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil. 

###### 7 
Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace, into a snare of the devil. ## Qualifications for Deacons 

###### 8 
Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain. 

###### 9 
They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. 

###### 10 
And let them also be tested first; then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless. 

###### 11 
Their wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober-minded, faithful in all things. 

###### 12 
Let deacons each be the husband of one wife, managing their children and their own households well. 

###### 13 
For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. ## The Mystery of Godliness 

###### 14 
I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these things to you so that, 

###### 15 
if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth. 

###### 16 
Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness: He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
