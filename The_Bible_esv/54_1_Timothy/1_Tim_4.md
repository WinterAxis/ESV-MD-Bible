###### 1 
Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, 

###### 2 
through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared, 

###### 3 
who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. 

###### 4 
For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, 

###### 5 
for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer. ## A Good Servant of Christ Jesus 

###### 6 
If you put these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, being trained in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine that you have followed. 

###### 7 
Have nothing to do with irreverent, silly myths. Rather train yourself for godliness; 

###### 8 
for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come. 

###### 9 
The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance. 

###### 10 
For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe. 

###### 11 
Command and teach these things. 

###### 12 
Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity. 

###### 13 
Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching. 

###### 14 
Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you by prophecy when the council of elders laid their hands on you. 

###### 15 
Practice these things, immerse yourself in them, so that all may see your progress. 

###### 16 
Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers.
