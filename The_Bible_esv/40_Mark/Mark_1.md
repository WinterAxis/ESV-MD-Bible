###### 1 


The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. 





###### 2 


As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way, 





###### 3 


the voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,'" 





###### 4 


John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. 





###### 5 


And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. 





###### 6 


Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. 





###### 7 


And he preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. 





###### 8 


I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." ## The Baptism of Jesus 





###### 9 


In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. 





###### 10 


And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. 





###### 11 


And a voice came from heaven, "You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased." ## The Temptation of Jesus 





###### 12 


The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. 





###### 13 


And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him. ## Jesus Begins His Ministry 





###### 14 


Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, 





###### 15 


and saying, **"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel."** ## Jesus Calls the First Disciples 





###### 16 


Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. 





###### 17 


And Jesus said to them, **"Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men."** 





###### 18 


And immediately they left their nets and followed him. 





###### 19 


And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. 





###### 20 


And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him. ## Jesus Heals a Man with an Unclean Spirit 





###### 21 


And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching. 





###### 22 


And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. 





###### 23 


And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, 





###### 24 


"What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God." 





###### 25 


But Jesus rebuked him, saying, **"Be silent, and come out of him!"** 





###### 26 


And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him. 





###### 27 


And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him." 





###### 28 


And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee. ## Jesus Heals Many 





###### 29 


And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 





###### 30 


Now Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. 





###### 31 


And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them. 





###### 32 


That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons. 





###### 33 


And the whole city was gathered together at the door. 





###### 34 


And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him. ## Jesus Preaches in Galilee 





###### 35 


And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed. 





###### 36 


And Simon and those who were with him searched for him, 





###### 37 


and they found him and said to him, "Everyone is looking for you." 





###### 38 


And he said to them, **"Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out."** 





###### 39 


And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. ## Jesus Cleanses a Leper 





###### 40 


And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, "If you will, you can make me clean." 





###### 41 


Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, **"I will; be clean."** 





###### 42 


And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. 





###### 43 


And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once, 





###### 44 


and said to him, **"See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them."** 





###### 45 


But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
