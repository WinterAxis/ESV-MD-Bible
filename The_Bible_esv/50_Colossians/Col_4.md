###### 1 

Masters, treat your bondservants justly and fairly, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven. ## Further Instructions 

###### 2 

Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving. 

###### 3 

At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison-- 

###### 4 

that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak. 

###### 5 

Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time. 

###### 6 

Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person. ## Final Greetings 

###### 7 

Tychicus will tell you all about my activities. He is a beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord. 

###### 8 

I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts, 

###### 9 

and with him Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you of everything that has taken place here. 

###### 10 

Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you have received instructions--if he comes to you, welcome him), 

###### 11 

and Jesus who is called Justus. These are the only men of the circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me. 

###### 12 

Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, greets you, always struggling on your behalf in his prayers, that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God. 

###### 13 

For I bear him witness that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis. 

###### 14 

Luke the beloved physician greets you, as does Demas. 

###### 15 

Give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house. 

###### 16 

And when this letter has been read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea. 

###### 17 

And say to Archippus, "See that you fulfill the ministry that you have received in the Lord." 

###### 18 

I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.
