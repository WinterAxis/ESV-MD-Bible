###### 1 

And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand! 

###### 2 

Then I said, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length." 

###### 3 

And behold, the angel who talked with me came forward, and another angel came forward to meet him 

###### 4 

and said to him, "Run, say to that young man, 'Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of people and livestock in it. 

###### 5 

And I will be to her a wall of fire all around, declares the LORD, and I will be the glory in her midst.'" 

###### 6 

Up! Up! Flee from the land of the north, declares the LORD. For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, declares the LORD. 

###### 7 

Up! Escape to Zion, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon. 

###### 8 

For thus said the LORD of hosts, after his glory sent me to the nations who plundered you, for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye: 

###### 9 

"Behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall become plunder for those who served them. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me. 

###### 10 

Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for behold, I come and I will dwell in your midst, declares the LORD. 

###### 11 

And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people. And I will dwell in your midst, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. 

###### 12 

And the LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem." 

###### 13 

Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD, for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.
