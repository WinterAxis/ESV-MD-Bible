###### 1 
Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted. 

###### 2 
Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. 

###### 3 
For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. 

###### 4 
But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor. 

###### 5 
For each will have to bear his own load. 

###### 6 
Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches. 

###### 7 
Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. 

###### 8 
For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. 

###### 9 
And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up. 

###### 10 
So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith. ## Final Warning and Benediction 

###### 11 
See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand. 

###### 12 
It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. 

###### 13 
For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. 

###### 14 
But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. 

###### 15 
For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. 

###### 16 
And as for all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God. 

###### 17 
From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. 

###### 18 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
