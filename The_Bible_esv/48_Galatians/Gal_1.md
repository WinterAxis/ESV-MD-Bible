###### 1 
Paul, an apostle--not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead-- 

###### 2 
and all the brothers who are with me, To the churches of Galatia: 

###### 3 
Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, 

###### 4 
who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, 

###### 5 
to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. ## No Other Gospel 

###### 6 
I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel-- 

###### 7 
not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. 

###### 8 
But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. 

###### 9 
As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. 

###### 10 
For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ. ## Paul Called by God 

###### 11 
For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man's gospel. 

###### 12 
For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. 

###### 13 
For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it. 

###### 14 
And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. 

###### 15 
But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace, 

###### 16 
was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone; 

###### 17 
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus. 

###### 18 
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days. 

###### 19 
But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother. 

###### 20 
(In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!) 

###### 21 
Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 

###### 22 
And I was still unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. 

###### 23 
They only were hearing it said, "He who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy." 

###### 24 
And they glorified God because of me.
