###### 1 
For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you. 

###### 2 
For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained? 

###### 3 
And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all. 

###### 4 
For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you. ## Forgive the Sinner 

###### 5 
Now if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure--not to put it too severely--to all of you. 

###### 6 
For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough, 

###### 7 
so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. 

###### 8 
So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him. 

###### 9 
For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything. 

###### 10 
Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ, 

###### 11 
so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs. ## Triumph in Christ 

###### 12 
When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord, 

###### 13 
my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia. 

###### 14 
But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. 

###### 15 
For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, 

###### 16 
to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? 

###### 17 
For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God's word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.
