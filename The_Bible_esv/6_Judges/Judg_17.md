###### 1 


There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. 





###### 2 


And he said to his mother, "The 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it." And his mother said, "Blessed be my son by the LORD." 





###### 3 


And he restored the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother. And his mother said, "I dedicate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a metal image. Now therefore I will restore it to you." 





###### 4 


So when he restored the money to his mother, his mother took 200 pieces of silver and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into a carved image and a metal image. And it was in the house of Micah. 





###### 5 


And the man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and household gods, and ordained one of his sons, who became his priest. 





###### 6 


In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes. 





###### 7 


Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. 





###### 8 


And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place. And as he journeyed, he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah. 





###### 9 


And Micah said to him, "Where do you come from?" And he said to him, "I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I may find a place." 





###### 10 


And Micah said to him, "Stay with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and a suit of clothes and your living." And the Levite went in. 





###### 11 


And the Levite was content to dwell with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons. 





###### 12 


And Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. 





###### 13 


Then Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, because I have a Levite as priest." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
