###### 1 


"Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. 





###### 2 


Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. 





###### 3 


For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, 





###### 4 


but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. 





###### 5 


As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. 





###### 6 


But at midnight there was a cry, 'Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.' 





###### 7 


Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. 





###### 8 


And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.' 





###### 9 


But the wise answered, saying, 'Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.' 





###### 10 


And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. 





###### 11 


Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, 'Lord, lord, open to us.' 





###### 12 


But he answered, 'Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.' 





###### 13 


Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour. ## The Parable of the Talents 





###### 14 


"For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. 





###### 15 


To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. 





###### 16 


He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. 





###### 17 


So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. 





###### 18 


But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. 





###### 19 


Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. 





###### 20 


And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me five talents; here, I have made five talents more.' 





###### 21 


His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.' 





###### 22 


And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me two talents; here, I have made two talents more.' 





###### 23 


His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.' 





###### 24 


He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, 





###### 25 


so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here, you have what is yours.' 





###### 26 


But his master answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed? 





###### 27 


Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. 





###### 28 


So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. 





###### 29 


For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. 





###### 30 


And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' ## The Final Judgment 





###### 31 


"When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. 





###### 32 


Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 





###### 33 


And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. 





###### 34 


Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 





###### 35 


For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, 





###### 36 


I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.' 





###### 37 


Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? 





###### 38 


And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? 





###### 39 


And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?' 





###### 40 


And the King will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.' 





###### 41 


"Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 





###### 42 


For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, 





###### 43 


I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.' 





###### 44 


Then they also will answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?' 





###### 45 


Then he will answer them, saying, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.' 





###### 46 


And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
