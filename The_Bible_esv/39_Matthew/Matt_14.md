###### 1 

At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus, 

###### 2 

and he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him." 

###### 3 

For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, 

###### 4 

because John had been saying to him, "It is not lawful for you to have her." 

###### 5 

And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. 

###### 6 

But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, 

###### 7 

so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. 

###### 8 

Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter." 

###### 9 

And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given. 

###### 10 

He sent and had John beheaded in the prison, 

###### 11 

and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. 

###### 12 

And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus. ## Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand 

###### 13 

Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns. 

###### 14 

When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. 

###### 15 

Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves." 

###### 16 

But Jesus said, **"They need not go away; you give them something to eat."** 

###### 17 

They said to him, "We have only five loaves here and two fish." 

###### 18 

And he said, **"Bring them here to me."** 

###### 19 

Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. 

###### 20 

And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over. 

###### 21 

And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children. ## Jesus Walks on the Water 

###### 22 

Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds. 

###### 23 

And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, 

###### 24 

but the boat by this time was a long way from the land, beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them. 

###### 25 

And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. 

###### 26 

But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, "It is a ghost!" and they cried out in fear. 

###### 27 

But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, **"Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid."** 

###### 28 

And Peter answered him, "Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water." 

###### 29 

He said, **"Come."** So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus. 

###### 30 

But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, "Lord, save me." 

###### 31 

Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, **"O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"** 

###### 32 

And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. 

###### 33 

And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God." ## Jesus Heals the Sick in Gennesaret 

###### 34 

And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. 

###### 35 

And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent around to all that region and brought to him all who were sick 

###### 36 

and implored him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well.
