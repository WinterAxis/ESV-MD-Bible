###### 1 


The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who know the truth, 





###### 2 


because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever: 





###### 3 


Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son, in truth and love. ## Walking in Truth and Love 





###### 4 


I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father. 





###### 5 


And now I ask you, dear lady--not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning--that we love one another. 





###### 6 


And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it. 





###### 7 


For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. 





###### 8 


Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward. 





###### 9 


Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. 





###### 10 


If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting, 





###### 11 


for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works. ## Final Greetings 





###### 12 


Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be complete. 





###### 13 


The children of your elect sister greet you. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
