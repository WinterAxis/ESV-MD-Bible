###### 1 


Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place and strengthened himself against Israel. 





###### 2 


He placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim that Asa his father had captured. 





###### 3 


The LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David. He did not seek the Baals, 





###### 4 


but sought the God of his father and walked in his commandments, and not according to the practices of Israel. 





###### 5 


Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand. And all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he had great riches and honor. 





###### 6 


His heart was courageous in the ways of the LORD. And furthermore, he took the high places and the Asherim out of Judah. 





###### 7 


In the third year of his reign he sent his officials, Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah; 





###### 8 


and with them the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah; and with these Levites, the priests Elishama and Jehoram. 





###### 9 


And they taught in Judah, having the Book of the Law of the LORD with them. They went about through all the cities of Judah and taught among the people. 





###### 10 


And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, and they made no war against Jehoshaphat. 





###### 11 


Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and silver for tribute, and the Arabians also brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats. 





###### 12 


And Jehoshaphat grew steadily greater. He built in Judah fortresses and store cities, 





###### 13 


and he had large supplies in the cities of Judah. He had soldiers, mighty men of valor, in Jerusalem. 





###### 14 


This was the muster of them by fathers' houses: Of Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander, with 300,000 mighty men of valor; 





###### 15 


and next to him Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000; 





###### 16 


and next to him Amasiah the son of Zichri, a volunteer for the service of the LORD, with 200,000 mighty men of valor. 





###### 17 


Of Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, with 200,000 men armed with bow and shield; 





###### 18 


and next to him Jehozabad with 180,000 armed for war. 





###### 19 


These were in the service of the king, besides those whom the king had placed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
