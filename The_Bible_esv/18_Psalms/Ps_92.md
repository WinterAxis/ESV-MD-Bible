###### 1 

It is good to give thanks to the LORD, to sing praises to your name, O Most High; 

###### 2 

to declare your steadfast love in the morning, and your faithfulness by night, 

###### 3 

to the music of the lute and the harp, to the melody of the lyre. 

###### 4 

For you, O LORD, have made me glad by your work; at the works of your hands I sing for joy. 

###### 5 

How great are your works, O LORD! Your thoughts are very deep! 

###### 6 

The stupid man cannot know; the fool cannot understand this: 

###### 7 

that though the wicked sprout like grass and all evildoers flourish, they are doomed to destruction forever; 

###### 8 

but you, O LORD, are on high forever. 

###### 9 

For behold, your enemies, O LORD, for behold, your enemies shall perish; all evildoers shall be scattered. 

###### 10 

But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox; you have poured over me fresh oil. 

###### 11 

My eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies; my ears have heard the doom of my evil assailants. 

###### 12 

The righteous flourish like the palm tree and grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 

###### 13 

They are planted in the house of the LORD; they flourish in the courts of our God. 

###### 14 

They still bear fruit in old age; they are ever full of sap and green, 

###### 15 

to declare that the LORD is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
