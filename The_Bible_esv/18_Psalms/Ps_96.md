###### 1 

Oh sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth! 

###### 2 

Sing to the LORD, bless his name; tell of his salvation from day to day. 

###### 3 

Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples! 

###### 4 

For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; he is to be feared above all gods. 

###### 5 

For all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols, but the LORD made the heavens. 

###### 6 

Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 

###### 7 

Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the peoples, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength! 

###### 8 

Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; bring an offering, and come into his courts! 

###### 9 

Worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness; tremble before him, all the earth! 

###### 10 

Say among the nations, "The LORD reigns! Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved; he will judge the peoples with equity." 

###### 11 

Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and all that fills it; 

###### 12 

let the field exult, and everything in it! Then shall all the trees of the forest sing for joy 

###### 13 

before the LORD, for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness, and the peoples in his faithfulness.
