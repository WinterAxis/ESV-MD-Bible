###### 1 

Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity! 



###### 2 

It is like the precious oil on the head, running down on the beard, on the beard of Aaron, running down on the collar of his robes! 



###### 3 

It is like the dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion! For there the LORD has commanded the blessing, life forevermore. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
