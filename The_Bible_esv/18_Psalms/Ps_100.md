***

###### 1 

Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth! 

###### 2 

Serve the LORD with gladness! Come into his presence with singing! 

###### 3 

Know that the LORD, he is God! It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 

###### 4 

Enter his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with praise! Give thanks to him; bless his name! 

###### 5 

For the LORD is good; his steadfast love endures forever, and his faithfulness to all generations.
