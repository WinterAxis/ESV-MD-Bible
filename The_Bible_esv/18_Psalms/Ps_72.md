###### 1 


Give the king your justice, O God, and your righteousness to the royal son! 





###### 2 


May he judge your people with righteousness, and your poor with justice! 





###### 3 


Let the mountains bear prosperity for the people, and the hills, in righteousness! 





###### 4 


May he defend the cause of the poor of the people, give deliverance to the children of the needy, and crush the oppressor! 





###### 5 


May they fear you while the sun endures, and as long as the moon, throughout all generations! 





###### 6 


May he be like rain that falls on the mown grass, like showers that water the earth! 





###### 7 


In his days may the righteous flourish, and peace abound, till the moon be no more! 





###### 8 


May he have dominion from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth! 





###### 9 


May desert tribes bow down before him, and his enemies lick the dust! 





###### 10 


May the kings of Tarshish and of the coastlands render him tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba bring gifts! 





###### 11 


May all kings fall down before him, all nations serve him! 





###### 12 


For he delivers the needy when he calls, the poor and him who has no helper. 





###### 13 


He has pity on the weak and the needy, and saves the lives of the needy. 





###### 14 


From oppression and violence he redeems their life, and precious is their blood in his sight. 





###### 15 


Long may he live; may gold of Sheba be given to him! May prayer be made for him continually, and blessings invoked for him all the day! 





###### 16 


May there be abundance of grain in the land; on the tops of the mountains may it wave; may its fruit be like Lebanon; and may people blossom in the cities like the grass of the field! 





###### 17 


May his name endure forever, his fame continue as long as the sun! May people be blessed in him, all nations call him blessed! 





###### 18 


Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who alone does wondrous things. 





###### 19 


Blessed be his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory! Amen and Amen! 





###### 20 


The prayers of David, the son of Jesse, are ended. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
