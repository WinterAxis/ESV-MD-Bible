###### 1 


We give thanks to you, O God; we give thanks, for your name is near. We recount your wondrous deeds. 





###### 2 


"At the set time that I appoint I will judge with equity. 





###### 3 


When the earth totters, and all its inhabitants, it is I who keep steady its pillars. Selah 





###### 4 


I say to the boastful, 'Do not boast,' and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your horn; 





###### 5 


do not lift up your horn on high, or speak with haughty neck.'" 





###### 6 


For not from the east or from the west and not from the wilderness comes lifting up, 





###### 7 


but it is God who executes judgment, putting down one and lifting up another. 





###### 8 


For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup with foaming wine, well mixed, and he pours out from it, and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs. 





###### 9 


But I will declare it forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 





###### 10 


All the horns of the wicked I will cut off, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
