###### 1 


My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, from the words of my groaning? 





###### 2 


O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer, and by night, but I find no rest. 





###### 3 


Yet you are holy, enthroned on the praises of Israel. 





###### 4 


In you our fathers trusted; they trusted, and you delivered them. 





###### 5 


To you they cried and were rescued; in you they trusted and were not put to shame. 





###### 6 


But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by mankind and despised by the people. 





###### 7 


All who see me mock me; they make mouths at me; they wag their heads; 





###### 8 


"He trusts in the LORD; let him deliver him; let him rescue him, for he delights in him!" 





###### 9 


Yet you are he who took me from the womb; you made me trust you at my mother's breasts. 





###### 10 


On you was I cast from my birth, and from my mother's womb you have been my God. 





###### 11 


Be not far from me, for trouble is near, and there is none to help. 





###### 12 


Many bulls encompass me; strong bulls of Bashan surround me; 





###### 13 


they open wide their mouths at me, like a ravening and roaring lion. 





###### 14 


I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax; it is melted within my breast; 





###### 15 


my strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to my jaws; you lay me in the dust of death. 





###### 16 


For dogs encompass me; a company of evildoers encircles me; they have pierced my hands and feet-- 





###### 17 


I can count all my bones-- they stare and gloat over me; 





###### 18 


they divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots. 





###### 19 


But you, O LORD, do not be far off! O you my help, come quickly to my aid! 





###### 20 


Deliver my soul from the sword, my precious life from the power of the dog! 





###### 21 


Save me from the mouth of the lion! You have rescued me from the horns of the wild oxen! 





###### 22 


I will tell of your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will praise you: 





###### 23 


You who fear the LORD, praise him! All you offspring of Jacob, glorify him, and stand in awe of him, all you offspring of Israel! 





###### 24 


For he has not despised or abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, and he has not hidden his face from him, but has heard, when he cried to him. 





###### 25 


From you comes my praise in the great congregation; my vows I will perform before those who fear him. 





###### 26 


The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied; those who seek him shall praise the LORD! May your hearts live forever! 





###### 27 


All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD, and all the families of the nations shall worship before you. 





###### 28 


For kingship belongs to the LORD, and he rules over the nations. 





###### 29 


All the prosperous of the earth eat and worship; before him shall bow all who go down to the dust, even the one who could not keep himself alive. 





###### 30 


Posterity shall serve him; it shall be told of the Lord to the coming generation; 





###### 31 


they shall come and proclaim his righteousness to a people yet unborn, that he has done it. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
