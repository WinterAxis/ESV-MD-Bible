###### 1 

In Judah God is known; his name is great in Israel. 

###### 2 

His abode has been established in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion. 

###### 3 

There he broke the flashing arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah 

###### 4 

Glorious are you, more majestic than the mountains full of prey. 

###### 5 

The stouthearted were stripped of their spoil; they sank into sleep; all the men of war were unable to use their hands. 

###### 6 

At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both rider and horse lay stunned. 

###### 7 

But you, you are to be feared! Who can stand before you when once your anger is roused? 

###### 8 

From the heavens you uttered judgment; the earth feared and was still, 

###### 9 

when God arose to establish judgment, to save all the humble of the earth. Selah 

###### 10 

Surely the wrath of man shall praise you; the remnant of wrath you will put on like a belt. 

###### 11 

Make your vows to the LORD your God and perform them; let all around him bring gifts to him who is to be feared, 

###### 12 

who cuts off the spirit of princes, who is to be feared by the kings of the earth.
