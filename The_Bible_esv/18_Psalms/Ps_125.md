***

###### 1 

Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever. 

###### 2 

As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds his people, from this time forth and forevermore. 

###### 3 

For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest on the land allotted to the righteous, lest the righteous stretch out their hands to do wrong. 

###### 4 

Do good, O LORD, to those who are good, and to those who are upright in their hearts! 

###### 5 

But those who turn aside to their crooked ways the LORD will lead away with evildoers! Peace be upon Israel!
