###### 1 

Fret not yourself because of evildoers; be not envious of wrongdoers! 

###### 2 

For they will soon fade like the grass and wither like the green herb. 

###### 3 

Trust in the LORD, and do good; dwell in the land and befriend faithfulness. 

###### 4 

Delight yourself in the LORD, and he will give you the desires of your heart. 

###### 5 

Commit your way to the LORD; trust in him, and he will act. 

###### 6 

He will bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your justice as the noonday. 

###### 7 

Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; fret not yourself over the one who prospers in his way, over the man who carries out evil devices! 

###### 8 

Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath! Fret not yourself; it tends only to evil. 

###### 9 

For the evildoers shall be cut off, but those who wait for the LORD shall inherit the land. 

###### 10 

In just a little while, the wicked will be no more; though you look carefully at his place, he will not be there. 

###### 11 

But the meek shall inherit the land and delight themselves in abundant peace. 

###### 12 

The wicked plots against the righteous and gnashes his teeth at him, 

###### 13 

but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he sees that his day is coming. 

###### 14 

The wicked draw the sword and bend their bows to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose way is upright; 

###### 15 

their sword shall enter their own heart, and their bows shall be broken. 

###### 16 

Better is the little that the righteous has than the abundance of many wicked. 

###### 17 

For the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous. 

###### 18 

The LORD knows the days of the blameless, and their heritage will remain forever; 

###### 19 

they are not put to shame in evil times; in the days of famine they have abundance. 

###### 20 

But the wicked will perish; the enemies of the LORD are like the glory of the pastures; they vanish--like smoke they vanish away. 

###### 21 

The wicked borrows but does not pay back, but the righteous is generous and gives; 

###### 22 

for those blessed by the LORD shall inherit the land, but those cursed by him shall be cut off. 

###### 23 

The steps of a man are established by the LORD, when he delights in his way; 

###### 24 

though he fall, he shall not be cast headlong, for the LORD upholds his hand. 

###### 25 

I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread. 

###### 26 

He is ever lending generously, and his children become a blessing. 

###### 27 

Turn away from evil and do good; so shall you dwell forever. 

###### 28 

For the LORD loves justice; he will not forsake his saints. They are preserved forever, but the children of the wicked shall be cut off. 

###### 29 

The righteous shall inherit the land and dwell upon it forever. 

###### 30 

The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice. 

###### 31 

The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not slip. 

###### 32 

The wicked watches for the righteous and seeks to put him to death. 

###### 33 

The LORD will not abandon him to his power or let him be condemned when he is brought to trial. 

###### 34 

Wait for the LORD and keep his way, and he will exalt you to inherit the land; you will look on when the wicked are cut off. 

###### 35 

I have seen a wicked, ruthless man, spreading himself like a green laurel tree. 

###### 36 

But he passed away, and behold, he was no more; though I sought him, he could not be found. 

###### 37 

Mark the blameless and behold the upright, for there is a future for the man of peace. 

###### 38 

But transgressors shall be altogether destroyed; the future of the wicked shall be cut off. 

###### 39 

The salvation of the righteous is from the LORD; he is their stronghold in the time of trouble. 

###### 40 

The LORD helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him.
