###### 1 

O LORD, I call upon you; hasten to me! Give ear to my voice when I call to you! 

###### 2 

Let my prayer be counted as incense before you, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice! 

###### 3 

Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips! 

###### 4 

Do not let my heart incline to any evil, to busy myself with wicked deeds in company with men who work iniquity, and let me not eat of their delicacies! 

###### 5 

Let a righteous man strike me--it is a kindness; let him rebuke me--it is oil for my head; let my head not refuse it. Yet my prayer is continually against their evil deeds. 

###### 6 

When their judges are thrown over the cliff, then they shall hear my words, for they are pleasant. 

###### 7 

As when one plows and breaks up the earth, so shall our bones be scattered at the mouth of Sheol. 

###### 8 

But my eyes are toward you, O God, my Lord; in you I seek refuge; leave me not defenseless! 

###### 9 

Keep me from the trap that they have laid for me and from the snares of evildoers! 

###### 10 

Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by safely.
