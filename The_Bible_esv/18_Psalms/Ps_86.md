###### 1 


Incline your ear, O LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy. 





###### 2 


Preserve my life, for I am godly; save your servant, who trusts in you--you are my God. 





###### 3 


Be gracious to me, O Lord, for to you do I cry all the day. 





###### 4 


Gladden the soul of your servant, for to you, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 





###### 5 


For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving, abounding in steadfast love to all who call upon you. 





###### 6 


Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; listen to my plea for grace. 





###### 7 


In the day of my trouble I call upon you, for you answer me. 





###### 8 


There is none like you among the gods, O Lord, nor are there any works like yours. 





###### 9 


All the nations you have made shall come and worship before you, O Lord, and shall glorify your name. 





###### 10 


For you are great and do wondrous things; you alone are God. 





###### 11 


Teach me your way, O LORD, that I may walk in your truth; unite my heart to fear your name. 





###### 12 


I give thanks to you, O Lord my God, with my whole heart, and I will glorify your name forever. 





###### 13 


For great is your steadfast love toward me; you have delivered my soul from the depths of Sheol. 





###### 14 


O God, insolent men have risen up against me; a band of ruthless men seeks my life, and they do not set you before them. 





###### 15 


But you, O Lord, are a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. 





###### 16 


Turn to me and be gracious to me; give your strength to your servant, and save the son of your maidservant. 





###### 17 


Show me a sign of your favor, that those who hate me may see and be put to shame because you, LORD, have helped me and comforted me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
