###### 1 

Praise the LORD! Praise, O servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD! 



###### 2 

Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and forevermore! 



###### 3 

From the rising of the sun to its setting, the name of the LORD is to be praised! 



###### 4 

The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens! 



###### 5 

Who is like the LORD our God, who is seated on high, 



###### 6 

who looks far down on the heavens and the earth? 



###### 7 

He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap, 



###### 8 

to make them sit with princes, with the princes of his people. 



###### 9 

He gives the barren woman a home, making her the joyous mother of children.
