###### 1 

O LORD, rebuke me not in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath! 

###### 2 

For your arrows have sunk into me, and your hand has come down on me. 

###### 3 

There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin. 

###### 4 

For my iniquities have gone over my head; like a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me. 

###### 5 

My wounds stink and fester because of my foolishness, 

###### 6 

I am utterly bowed down and prostrate; all the day I go about mourning. 

###### 7 

For my sides are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh. 

###### 8 

I am feeble and crushed; I groan because of the tumult of my heart. 

###### 9 

O Lord, all my longing is before you; my sighing is not hidden from you. 

###### 10 

My heart throbs; my strength fails me, and the light of my eyes--it also has gone from me. 

###### 11 

My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague, and my nearest kin stand far off. 

###### 12 

Those who seek my life lay their snares; those who seek my hurt speak of ruin and meditate treachery all day long. 

###### 13 

But I am like a deaf man; I do not hear, like a mute man who does not open his mouth. 

###### 14 

I have become like a man who does not hear, and in whose mouth are no rebukes. 

###### 15 

But for you, O LORD, do I wait; it is you, O Lord my God, who will answer. 

###### 16 

For I said, "Only let them not rejoice over me, who boast against me when my foot slips!" 

###### 17 

For I am ready to fall, and my pain is ever before me. 

###### 18 

I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin. 

###### 19 

But my foes are vigorous, they are mighty, and many are those who hate me wrongfully. 

###### 20 

Those who render me evil for good accuse me because I follow after good. 

###### 21 

Do not forsake me, O LORD! O my God, be not far from me! 

###### 22 

Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation!
