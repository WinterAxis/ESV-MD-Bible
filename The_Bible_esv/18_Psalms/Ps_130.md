###### 1 

Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD! 

###### 2 

O Lord, hear my voice! Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my pleas for mercy! 

###### 3 

If you, O LORD, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? 

###### 4 

But with you there is forgiveness, that you may be feared. 

###### 5 

I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and in his word I hope; 

###### 6 

my soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning, more than watchmen for the morning. 

###### 7 

O Israel, hope in the LORD! For with the LORD there is steadfast love, and with him is plentiful redemption. 

###### 8 

And he will redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
