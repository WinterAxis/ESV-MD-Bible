***

###### 1 

Make haste, O God, to deliver me! O LORD, make haste to help me! 

###### 2 

Let them be put to shame and confusion who seek my life! Let them be turned back and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt! 

###### 3 

Let them turn back because of their shame who say, "Aha, Aha!" 

###### 4 

May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you! May those who love your salvation say evermore, "God is great!" 

###### 5 

But I am poor and needy; hasten to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay!
