###### 1 


Make haste, O God, to deliver me! O LORD, make haste to help me! 





###### 2 


Let them be put to shame and confusion who seek my life! Let them be turned back and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt! 





###### 3 


Let them turn back because of their shame who say, "Aha, Aha!" 





###### 4 


May all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you! May those who love your salvation say evermore, "God is great!" 





###### 5 


But I am poor and needy; hasten to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
