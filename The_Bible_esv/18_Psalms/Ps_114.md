###### 1 

When Israel went out from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language, 



###### 2 

Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. 



###### 3 

The sea looked and fled; Jordan turned back. 



###### 4 

The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs. 



###### 5 

What ails you, O sea, that you flee? O Jordan, that you turn back? 



###### 6 

O mountains, that you skip like rams? O hills, like lambs? 



###### 7

###### 8 

who turns the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a spring of water. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
