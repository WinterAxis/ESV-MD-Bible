###### 1 

Bless the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, you are very great! You are clothed with splendor and majesty, 

###### 2 

covering yourself with light as with a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent. 

###### 3 

He lays the beams of his chambers on the waters; he makes the clouds his chariot; he rides on the wings of the wind; 

###### 4 

he makes his messengers winds, his ministers a flaming fire. 

###### 5 

He set the earth on its foundations, so that it should never be moved. 

###### 6 

You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains. 

###### 7 

At your rebuke they fled; at the sound of your thunder they took to flight. 

###### 8 

The mountains rose, the valleys sank down to the place that you appointed for them. 

###### 9 

You set a boundary that they may not pass, so that they might not again cover the earth. 

###### 10 

You make springs gush forth in the valleys; they flow between the hills; 

###### 11 

they give drink to every beast of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst. 

###### 12 

Beside them the birds of the heavens dwell; they sing among the branches. 

###### 13 

From your lofty abode you water the mountains; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of your work. 

###### 14 

You cause the grass to grow for the livestock and plants for man to cultivate, that he may bring forth food from the earth 

###### 15 

and wine to gladden the heart of man, oil to make his face shine and bread to strengthen man's heart. 

###### 16 

The trees of the LORD are watered abundantly, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted. 

###### 17 

In them the birds build their nests; the stork has her home in the fir trees. 

###### 18 

The high mountains are for the wild goats; the rocks are a refuge for the rock badgers. 

###### 19 

He made the moon to mark the seasons; the sun knows its time for setting. 

###### 20 

You make darkness, and it is night, when all the beasts of the forest creep about. 

###### 21 

The young lions roar for their prey, seeking their food from God. 

###### 22 

When the sun rises, they steal away and lie down in their dens. 

###### 23 

Man goes out to his work and to his labor until the evening. 

###### 24 

O LORD, how manifold are your works! In wisdom have you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures. 

###### 25 

Here is the sea, great and wide, which teems with creatures innumerable, living things both small and great. 

###### 26 

There go the ships, and Leviathan, which you formed to play in it. 

###### 27 

These all look to you, to give them their food in due season. 

###### 28 

When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are filled with good things. 

###### 29 

When you hide your face, they are dismayed; when you take away their breath, they die and return to their dust. 

###### 30 

When you send forth your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the ground. 

###### 31 

May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works, 

###### 32 

who looks on the earth and it trembles, who touches the mountains and they smoke! 

###### 33 

I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God while I have being. 

###### 34 

May my meditation be pleasing to him, for I rejoice in the LORD. 

###### 35 

Let sinners be consumed from the earth, and let the wicked be no more! Bless the LORD, O my soul! Praise the LORD!
