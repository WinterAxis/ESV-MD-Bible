###### 1 


O LORD, how many are my foes! Many are rising against me; 





###### 2 


many are saying of my soul, "There is no salvation for him in God." Selah 





###### 3 


But you, O LORD, are a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head. 





###### 4 


I cried aloud to the LORD, and he answered me from his holy hill. Selah 





###### 5 


I lay down and slept; I woke again, for the LORD sustained me. 





###### 6 


I will not be afraid of many thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around. 





###### 7 


Arise, O LORD! Save me, O my God! For you strike all my enemies on the cheek; you break the teeth of the wicked. 





###### 8 


Salvation belongs to the LORD; your blessing be on your people!
