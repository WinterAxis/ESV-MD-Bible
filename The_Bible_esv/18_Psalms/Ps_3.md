###### 1 

O LORD, how many are my foes! Many are rising against me; 

###### 2 

many are saying of my soul, "There is no salvation for him in God." Selah 

###### 3 

But you, O LORD, are a shield about me, my glory, and the lifter of my head. 

###### 4 

I cried aloud to the LORD, and he answered me from his holy hill. Selah 

###### 5 

I lay down and slept; I woke again, for the LORD sustained me. 

###### 6 

I will not be afraid of many thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around. 

###### 7 

Arise, O LORD! Save me, O my God! For you strike all my enemies on the cheek; you break the teeth of the wicked. 

###### 8 

Salvation belongs to the LORD; your blessing be on your people! Selah
