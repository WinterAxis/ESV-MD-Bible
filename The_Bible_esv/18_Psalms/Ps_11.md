***

###### 1 

In the LORD I take refuge; how can you say to my soul, "Flee like a bird to your mountain, 

###### 2 

for behold, the wicked bend the bow; they have fitted their arrow to the string to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart; 

###### 3 

if the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?" 

###### 4 

The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD's throne is in heaven; his eyes see, his eyelids test the children of man. 

###### 5 

The LORD tests the righteous, but his soul hates the wicked and the one who loves violence. 

###### 6 

Let him rain coals on the wicked; fire and sulfur and a scorching wind shall be the portion of their cup. 

###### 7 

For the LORD is righteous; he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face.
