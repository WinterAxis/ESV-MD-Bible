***

###### 1 

"Greatly have they afflicted me from my youth"-- let Israel now say-- 

###### 2 

"Greatly have they afflicted me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed against me. 

###### 3 

The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows." 

###### 4 

The LORD is righteous; he has cut the cords of the wicked. 

###### 5 

May all who hate Zion be put to shame and turned backward! 

###### 6 

Let them be like the grass on the housetops, which withers before it grows up, 

###### 7 

with which the reaper does not fill his hand nor the binder of sheaves his arms, 

###### 8 

nor do those who pass by say, "The blessing of the LORD be upon you! We bless you in the name of the LORD!"
