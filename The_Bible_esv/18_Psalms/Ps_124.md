###### 1 

If it had not been the LORD who was on our side-- let Israel now say-- 



###### 2 

if it had not been the LORD who was on our side when people rose up against us, 



###### 3 

then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their anger was kindled against us; 



###### 4 

then the flood would have swept us away, the torrent would have gone over us; 



###### 5 

then over us would have gone the raging waters. 



###### 6 

Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth! 



###### 7 

We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped! 



###### 8 

Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
