***

###### 1 

If it had not been the LORD who was on our side-- let Israel now say-- 

###### 2 

if it had not been the LORD who was on our side when people rose up against us, 

###### 3 

then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their anger was kindled against us; 

###### 4 

then the flood would have swept us away, the torrent would have gone over us; 

###### 5 

then over us would have gone the raging waters. 

###### 6 

Blessed be the LORD, who has not given us as prey to their teeth! 

###### 7 

We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped! 

###### 8 

Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
