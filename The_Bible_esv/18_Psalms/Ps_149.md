###### 1 

Praise the LORD! Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise in the assembly of the godly! 

###### 2 

Let Israel be glad in his Maker; let the children of Zion rejoice in their King! 

###### 3 

Let them praise his name with dancing, making melody to him with tambourine and lyre! 

###### 4 

For the LORD takes pleasure in his people; he adorns the humble with salvation. 

###### 5 

Let the godly exult in glory; let them sing for joy on their beds. 

###### 6 

Let the high praises of God be in their throats and two-edged swords in their hands, 

###### 7 

to execute vengeance on the nations and punishments on the peoples, 

###### 8 

to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron, 

###### 9 

to execute on them the judgment written! This is honor for all his godly ones. Praise the LORD!
