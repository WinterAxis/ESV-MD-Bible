###### 1 

Deliver me, O LORD, from evil men; preserve me from violent men, 



###### 2 

who plan evil things in their heart and stir up wars continually. 



###### 3 

They make their tongue sharp as a serpent's, and under their lips is the venom of asps. Selah 



###### 4 

Guard me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from violent men, who have planned to trip up my feet. 



###### 5 

The arrogant have hidden a trap for me, and with cords they have spread a net; beside the way they have set snares for me. Selah 



###### 6 

I say to the LORD, You are my God; give ear to the voice of my pleas for mercy, O LORD! 



###### 7 

O LORD, my Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have covered my head in the day of battle. 



###### 8 

Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; do not further their evil plot, or they will be exalted! Selah 



###### 9 

As for the head of those who surround me, let the mischief of their lips overwhelm them! 



###### 10 

Let burning coals fall upon them! Let them be cast into fire, into miry pits, no more to rise! 



###### 11 

Let not the slanderer be established in the land; let evil hunt down the violent man speedily! 



###### 12 

I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and will execute justice for the needy. 



###### 13 

Surely the righteous shall give thanks to your name; the upright shall dwell in your presence. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
