###### 1 


I said, "I will guard my ways, that I may not sin with my tongue; I will guard my mouth with a muzzle, so long as the wicked are in my presence." 





###### 2 


I was mute and silent; I held my peace to no avail, and my distress grew worse. 





###### 3 


My heart became hot within me. As I mused, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue: 





###### 4 


"O LORD, make me know my end and what is the measure of my days; let me know how fleeting I am! 





###### 5 


Behold, you have made my days a few handbreadths, and my lifetime is as nothing before you. Surely all mankind stands as a mere breath! Selah 





###### 6 


Surely a man goes about as a shadow! Surely for nothing they are in turmoil; man heaps up wealth and does not know who will gather! 





###### 7 


"And now, O Lord, for what do I wait? My hope is in you. 





###### 8 


Deliver me from all my transgressions. Do not make me the scorn of the fool! 





###### 9 


I am mute; I do not open my mouth, for it is you who have done it. 





###### 10 


Remove your stroke from me; I am spent by the hostility of your hand. 





###### 11 


When you discipline a man with rebukes for sin, you consume like a moth what is dear to him; surely all mankind is a mere breath! Selah 





###### 12 


"Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear to my cry; hold not your peace at my tears! For I am a sojourner with you, a guest, like all my fathers. 





###### 13 


Look away from me, that I may smile again, before I depart and am no more!" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
