###### 1 

I will extol you, O LORD, for you have drawn me up and have not let my foes rejoice over me. 

###### 2 

O LORD my God, I cried to you for help, and you have healed me. 

###### 3 

O LORD, you have brought up my soul from Sheol; you restored me to life from among those who go down to the pit. 

###### 4 

Sing praises to the LORD, O you his saints, and give thanks to his holy name. 

###### 5 

For his anger is but for a moment, and his favor is for a lifetime. Weeping may tarry for the night, but joy comes with the morning. 

###### 6 

As for me, I said in my prosperity, "I shall never be moved." 

###### 7 

By your favor, O LORD, you made my mountain stand strong; you hid your face; I was dismayed. 

###### 8 

To you, O LORD, I cry, and to the Lord I plead for mercy: 

###### 9 

"What profit is there in my death, if I go down to the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it tell of your faithfulness? 

###### 10 

Hear, O LORD, and be merciful to me! O LORD, be my helper!" 

###### 11 

You have turned for me my mourning into dancing; you have loosed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness, 

###### 12 

that my glory may sing your praise and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks to you forever!
