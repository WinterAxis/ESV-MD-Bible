###### 1 

Why do you boast of evil, O mighty man? The steadfast love of God endures all the day. 

###### 2 

Your tongue plots destruction, like a sharp razor, you worker of deceit. 

###### 3 

You love evil more than good, and lying more than speaking what is right. Selah 

###### 4 

You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue. 

###### 5 

But God will break you down forever; he will snatch and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah 

###### 6 

The righteous shall see and fear, and shall laugh at him, saying, 

###### 7 

"See the man who would not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his riches and sought refuge in his own destruction!" 

###### 8 

But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God. I trust in the steadfast love of God forever and ever. 

###### 9 

I will thank you forever, because you have done it. I will wait for your name, for it is good, in the presence of the godly.
