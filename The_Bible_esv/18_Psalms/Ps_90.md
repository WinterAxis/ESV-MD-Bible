###### 1 

Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations. 

###### 2 

Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting to everlasting you are God. 

###### 3 

You return man to dust and say, "Return, O children of man!" 

###### 4 

For a thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night. 

###### 5 

You sweep them away as with a flood; they are like a dream, like grass that is renewed in the morning: 

###### 6 

in the morning it flourishes and is renewed; in the evening it fades and withers. 

###### 7 

For we are brought to an end by your anger; by your wrath we are dismayed. 

###### 8 

You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence. 

###### 9 

For all our days pass away under your wrath; we bring our years to an end like a sigh. 

###### 10 

The years of our life are seventy, or even by reason of strength eighty; yet their span is but toil and trouble; they are soon gone, and we fly away. 

###### 11 

Who considers the power of your anger, and your wrath according to the fear of you? 

###### 12 

So teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom. 

###### 13 

Return, O LORD! How long? Have pity on your servants! 

###### 14 

Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days. 

###### 15 

Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us, and for as many years as we have seen evil. 

###### 16 

Let your work be shown to your servants, and your glorious power to their children. 

###### 17 

Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish the work of our hands upon us; yes, establish the work of our hands!
