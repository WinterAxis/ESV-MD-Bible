###### 1 


LORD, you were favorable to your land; you restored the fortunes of Jacob. 





###### 2 


You forgave the iniquity of your people; you covered all their sin. Selah 





###### 3 


You withdrew all your wrath; you turned from your hot anger. 





###### 4 


Restore us again, O God of our salvation, and put away your indignation toward us! 





###### 5 


Will you be angry with us forever? Will you prolong your anger to all generations? 





###### 6 


Will you not revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you? 





###### 7 


Show us your steadfast love, O LORD, and grant us your salvation. 





###### 8 


Let me hear what God the LORD will speak, for he will speak peace to his people, to his saints; but let them not turn back to folly. 





###### 9 


Surely his salvation is near to those who fear him, that glory may dwell in our land. 





###### 10 


Steadfast love and faithfulness meet; righteousness and peace kiss each other. 





###### 11 


Faithfulness springs up from the ground, and righteousness looks down from the sky. 





###### 12 


Yes, the LORD will give what is good, and our land will yield its increase. 





###### 13 


Righteousness will go before him and make his footsteps a way. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
