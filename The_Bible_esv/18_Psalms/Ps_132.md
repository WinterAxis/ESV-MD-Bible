###### 1 

Remember, O LORD, in David's favor, all the hardships he endured, 

###### 2 

how he swore to the LORD and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob, 

###### 3 

"I will not enter my house or get into my bed, 

###### 4 

I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids, 

###### 5 

until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob." 

###### 6 

Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar. 

###### 7 

"Let us go to his dwelling place; let us worship at his footstool!" 

###### 8 

Arise, O LORD, and go to your resting place, you and the ark of your might. 

###### 9 

Let your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let your saints shout for joy. 

###### 10 

For the sake of your servant David, do not turn away the face of your anointed one. 

###### 11 

The LORD swore to David a sure oath from which he will not turn back: "One of the sons of your body I will set on your throne. 

###### 12 

If your sons keep my covenant and my testimonies that I shall teach them, their sons also forever shall sit on your throne." 

###### 13 

For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his dwelling place: 

###### 14 

"This is my resting place forever; here I will dwell, for I have desired it. 

###### 15 

I will abundantly bless her provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread. 

###### 16 

Her priests I will clothe with salvation, and her saints will shout for joy. 

###### 17 

There I will make a horn to sprout for David; I have prepared a lamp for my anointed. 

###### 18 

His enemies I will clothe with shame, but on him his crown will shine."
