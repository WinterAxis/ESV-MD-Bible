###### 1 

Give ear to my prayer, O God, and hide not yourself from my plea for mercy! 

###### 2 

Attend to me, and answer me; I am restless in my complaint and I moan, 

###### 3 

because of the noise of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked. For they drop trouble upon me, and in anger they bear a grudge against me. 

###### 4 

My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death have fallen upon me. 

###### 5 

Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror overwhelms me. 

###### 6 

And I say, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and be at rest; 

###### 7 

yes, I would wander far away; I would lodge in the wilderness; Selah 

###### 8 

I would hurry to find a shelter from the raging wind and tempest." 

###### 9 

Destroy, O Lord, divide their tongues; for I see violence and strife in the city. 

###### 10 

Day and night they go around it on its walls, and iniquity and trouble are within it; 

###### 11 

ruin is in its midst; oppression and fraud do not depart from its marketplace. 

###### 12 

For it is not an enemy who taunts me-- then I could bear it; it is not an adversary who deals insolently with me-- then I could hide from him. 

###### 13 

But it is you, a man, my equal, my companion, my familiar friend. 

###### 14 

We used to take sweet counsel together; within God's house we walked in the throng. 

###### 15 

Let death steal over them; let them go down to Sheol alive; for evil is in their dwelling place and in their heart. 

###### 16 

But I call to God, and the LORD will save me. 

###### 17 

Evening and morning and at noon I utter my complaint and moan, and he hears my voice. 

###### 18 

He redeems my soul in safety from the battle that I wage, for many are arrayed against me. 

###### 19 

God will give ear and humble them, he who is enthroned from of old, Selah because they do not change and do not fear God. 

###### 20 

My companion stretched out his hand against his friends; he violated his covenant. 

###### 21 

His speech was smooth as butter, yet war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords. 

###### 22 

Cast your burden on the LORD, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved. 

###### 23 

But you, O God, will cast them down into the pit of destruction; men of blood and treachery shall not live out half their days. But I will trust in you.
