###### 1 

Truly God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart. 

###### 2 

But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled, my steps had nearly slipped. 

###### 3 

For I was envious of the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. 

###### 4 

For they have no pangs until death; their bodies are fat and sleek. 

###### 5 

They are not in trouble as others are; they are not stricken like the rest of mankind. 

###### 6 

Therefore pride is their necklace; violence covers them as a garment. 

###### 7 

Their eyes swell out through fatness; their hearts overflow with follies. 

###### 8 

They scoff and speak with malice; loftily they threaten oppression. 

###### 9 

They set their mouths against the heavens, and their tongue struts through the earth. 

###### 10 

Therefore his people turn back to them, and find no fault in them. 

###### 11 

And they say, "How can God know? Is there knowledge in the Most High?" 

###### 12 

Behold, these are the wicked; always at ease, they increase in riches. 

###### 13 

All in vain have I kept my heart clean and washed my hands in innocence. 

###### 14 

For all the day long I have been stricken and rebuked every morning. 

###### 15 

If I had said, "I will speak thus," I would have betrayed the generation of your children. 

###### 16 

But when I thought how to understand this, it seemed to me a wearisome task, 

###### 17 

until I went into the sanctuary of God; then I discerned their end. 

###### 18 

Truly you set them in slippery places; you make them fall to ruin. 

###### 19 

How they are destroyed in a moment, swept away utterly by terrors! 

###### 20 

Like a dream when one awakes, O Lord, when you rouse yourself, you despise them as phantoms. 

###### 21 

When my soul was embittered, when I was pricked in heart, 

###### 22 

I was brutish and ignorant; I was like a beast toward you. 

###### 23 

Nevertheless, I am continually with you; you hold my right hand. 

###### 24 

You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will receive me to glory. 

###### 25 

Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you. 

###### 26 

My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. 

###### 27 

For behold, those who are far from you shall perish; you put an end to everyone who is unfaithful to you. 

###### 28 

But for me it is good to be near God; I have made the Lord God my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.
