###### 1 


Hear my cry, O God, listen to my prayer; 





###### 2 


from the end of the earth I call to you when my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I, 





###### 3 


for you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy. 





###### 4 


Let me dwell in your tent forever! Let me take refuge under the shelter of your wings! Selah 





###### 5 


For you, O God, have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name. 





###### 6 


Prolong the life of the king; may his years endure to all generations! 





###### 7 


May he be enthroned forever before God; appoint steadfast love and faithfulness to watch over him! 





###### 8 


So will I ever sing praises to your name, as I perform my vows day after day. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
