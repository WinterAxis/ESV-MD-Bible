###### 1 

Hear my cry, O God, listen to my prayer; 

###### 2 

from the end of the earth I call to you when my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I, 

###### 3 

for you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy. 

###### 4 

Let me dwell in your tent forever! Let me take refuge under the shelter of your wings! Selah 

###### 5 

For you, O God, have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name. 

###### 6 

Prolong the life of the king; may his years endure to all generations! 

###### 7 

May he be enthroned forever before God; appoint steadfast love and faithfulness to watch over him! 

###### 8 

So will I ever sing praises to your name, as I perform my vows day after day.
