###### 1 

He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty. 

###### 2 

I will say to the LORD, "My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust." 

###### 3 

For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence. 

###### 4 

He will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler. 

###### 5 

You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day, 

###### 6 

nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the destruction that wastes at noonday. 

###### 7 

A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you. 

###### 8 

You will only look with your eyes and see the recompense of the wicked. 

###### 9 

Because you have made the LORD your dwelling place-- the Most High, who is my refuge-- 

###### 10 

no evil shall be allowed to befall you, no plague come near your tent. 

###### 11 

For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways. 

###### 12 

On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone. 

###### 13 

You will tread on the lion and the adder; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot. 

###### 14 

"Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him; I will protect him, because he knows my name. 

###### 15 

When he calls to me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him and honor him. 

###### 16 

With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation."
