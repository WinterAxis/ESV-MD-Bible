***

###### 1 

The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds; there is none who does good. 

###### 2 

The LORD looks down from heaven on the children of man, to see if there are any who understand, who seek after God. 

###### 3 

They have all turned aside; together they have become corrupt; there is none who does good, not even one. 

###### 4 

Have they no knowledge, all the evildoers who eat up my people as they eat bread and do not call upon the LORD? 

###### 5 

There they are in great terror, for God is with the generation of the righteous. 

###### 6 

You would shame the plans of the poor, but the LORD is his refuge. 

###### 7 

Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When the LORD restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
