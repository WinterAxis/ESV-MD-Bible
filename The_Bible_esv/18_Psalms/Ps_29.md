###### 1 

Ascribe to the LORD, O heavenly beings, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength. 

###### 2 

Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness. 

###### 3 

The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the God of glory thunders, the LORD, over many waters. 

###### 4 

The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty. 

###### 5 

The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; the LORD breaks the cedars of Lebanon. 

###### 6 

He makes Lebanon to skip like a calf, and Sirion like a young wild ox. 

###### 7 

The voice of the LORD flashes forth flames of fire. 

###### 8 

The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. 

###### 9 

The voice of the LORD makes the deer give birth and strips the forests bare, and in his temple all cry, "Glory!" 

###### 10 

The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; the LORD sits enthroned as king forever. 

###### 11 

May the LORD give strength to his people! May the LORD bless his people with peace!
