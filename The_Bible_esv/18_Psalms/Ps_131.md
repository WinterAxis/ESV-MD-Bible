***

###### 1 

O LORD, my heart is not lifted up; my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself with things too great and too marvelous for me. 

###### 2 

But I have calmed and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with its mother; like a weaned child is my soul within me. 

###### 3 

O Israel, hope in the LORD from this time forth and forevermore.
