###### 1 

Bless the LORD, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name! 



###### 2 

Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits, 



###### 3 

who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases, 



###### 4 

who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy, 



###### 5 

who satisfies you with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's. 



###### 6 

The LORD works righteousness and justice for all who are oppressed. 



###### 7 

He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the people of Israel. 



###### 8 

The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love. 



###### 9 

He will not always chide, nor will he keep his anger forever. 



###### 10 

He does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities. 



###### 11 

For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those who fear him; 



###### 12 

as far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us. 



###### 13 

As a father shows compassion to his children, so the LORD shows compassion to those who fear him. 



###### 14 

For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust. 



###### 15 

As for man, his days are like grass; he flourishes like a flower of the field; 



###### 16 

for the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place knows it no more. 



###### 17 

But the steadfast love of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear him, and his righteousness to children's children, 



###### 18 

to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his commandments. 



###### 19 

The LORD has established his throne in the heavens, and his kingdom rules over all. 



###### 20 

Bless the LORD, O you his angels, you mighty ones who do his word, obeying the voice of his word! 



###### 21 

Bless the LORD, all his hosts, his ministers, who do his will! 



###### 22 

Bless the LORD, all his works, in all places of his dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
