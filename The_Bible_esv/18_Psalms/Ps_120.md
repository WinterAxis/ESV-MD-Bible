###### 1 

In my distress I called to the LORD, and he answered me. 



###### 2 

Deliver me, O LORD, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue. 



###### 3 

What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done to you, you deceitful tongue? 



###### 4 

A warrior's sharp arrows, with glowing coals of the broom tree! 



###### 5 

Woe to me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell among the tents of Kedar! 



###### 6 

Too long have I had my dwelling among those who hate peace. 



###### 7 

I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
