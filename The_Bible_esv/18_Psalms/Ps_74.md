###### 1 

O God, why do you cast us off forever? Why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture? 

###### 2 

Remember your congregation, which you have purchased of old, which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your heritage! Remember Mount Zion, where you have dwelt. 

###### 3 

Direct your steps to the perpetual ruins; the enemy has destroyed everything in the sanctuary! 

###### 4 

Your foes have roared in the midst of your meeting place; they set up their own signs for signs. 

###### 5 

They were like those who swing axes in a forest of trees. 

###### 6 

And all its carved wood they broke down with hatchets and hammers. 

###### 7 

They set your sanctuary on fire; they profaned the dwelling place of your name, bringing it down to the ground. 

###### 8 

They said to themselves, "We will utterly subdue them"; they burned all the meeting places of God in the land. 

###### 9 

We do not see our signs; there is no longer any prophet, and there is none among us who knows how long. 

###### 10 

How long, O God, is the foe to scoff? Is the enemy to revile your name forever? 

###### 11 

Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the fold of your garment and destroy them! 

###### 12 

Yet God my King is from of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. 

###### 13 

You divided the sea by your might; you broke the heads of the sea monsters on the waters. 

###### 14 

You crushed the heads of Leviathan; you gave him as food for the creatures of the wilderness. 

###### 15 

You split open springs and brooks; you dried up ever-flowing streams. 

###### 16 

Yours is the day, yours also the night; you have established the heavenly lights and the sun. 

###### 17 

You have fixed all the boundaries of the earth; you have made summer and winter. 

###### 18 

Remember this, O LORD, how the enemy scoffs, and a foolish people reviles your name. 

###### 19 

Do not deliver the soul of your dove to the wild beasts; do not forget the life of your poor forever. 

###### 20 

Have regard for the covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence. 

###### 21 

Let not the downtrodden turn back in shame; let the poor and needy praise your name. 

###### 22 

Arise, O God, defend your cause; remember how the foolish scoff at you all the day! 

###### 23 

Do not forget the clamor of your foes, the uproar of those who rise against you, which goes up continually!
