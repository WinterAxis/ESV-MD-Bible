###### 1 

O God, do not keep silence; do not hold your peace or be still, O God! 

###### 2 

For behold, your enemies make an uproar; those who hate you have raised their heads. 

###### 3 

They lay crafty plans against your people; they consult together against your treasured ones. 

###### 4 

They say, "Come, let us wipe them out as a nation; let the name of Israel be remembered no more!" 

###### 5 

For they conspire with one accord; against you they make a covenant-- 

###### 6 

the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites, 

###### 7 

Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre; 

###### 8 

Asshur also has joined them; they are the strong arm of the children of Lot. Selah 

###### 9 

Do to them as you did to Midian, as to Sisera and Jabin at the river Kishon, 

###### 10 

who were destroyed at En-dor, who became dung for the ground. 

###### 11 

Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna, 

###### 12 

who said, "Let us take possession for ourselves of the pastures of God." 

###### 13 

O my God, make them like whirling dust, like chaff before the wind. 

###### 14 

As fire consumes the forest, as the flame sets the mountains ablaze, 

###### 15 

so may you pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your hurricane! 

###### 16 

Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek your name, O LORD. 

###### 17 

Let them be put to shame and dismayed forever; let them perish in disgrace, 

###### 18 

that they may know that you alone, whose name is the LORD, are the Most High over all the earth.
