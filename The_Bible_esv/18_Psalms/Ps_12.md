***

###### 1 

Save, O LORD, for the godly one is gone; for the faithful have vanished from among the children of man. 

###### 2 

Everyone utters lies to his neighbor; with flattering lips and a double heart they speak. 

###### 3 

May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that makes great boasts, 

###### 4 

those who say, "With our tongue we will prevail, our lips are with us; who is master over us?" 

###### 5 

"Because the poor are plundered, because the needy groan, I will now arise," says the LORD; "I will place him in the safety for which he longs." 

###### 6 

The words of the LORD are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times. 

###### 7 

You, O LORD, will keep them; you will guard us from this generation forever. 

###### 8 

On every side the wicked prowl, as vileness is exalted among the children of man.
