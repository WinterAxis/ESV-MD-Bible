###### 1 


The LORD reigns; he is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed; he has put on strength as his belt. Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved. 





###### 2 


Your throne is established from of old; you are from everlasting. 





###### 3 


The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their roaring. 





###### 4 


Mightier than the thunders of many waters, mightier than the waves of the sea, the LORD on high is mighty! 





###### 5 


Your decrees are very trustworthy; holiness befits your house, O LORD, forevermore. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
