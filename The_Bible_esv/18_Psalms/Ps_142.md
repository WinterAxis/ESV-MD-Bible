***

###### 1 

With my voice I cry out to the LORD; with my voice I plead for mercy to the LORD. 

###### 2 

I pour out my complaint before him; I tell my trouble before him. 

###### 3 

When my spirit faints within me, you know my way! In the path where I walk they have hidden a trap for me. 

###### 4 

Look to the right and see: there is none who takes notice of me; no refuge remains to me; no one cares for my soul. 

###### 5 

I cry to you, O LORD; I say, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living." 

###### 6 

Attend to my cry, for I am brought very low! Deliver me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me! 

###### 7 

Bring me out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name! The righteous will surround me, for you will deal bountifully with me.
