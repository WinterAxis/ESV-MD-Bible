***

###### 1 

On the holy mount stands the city he founded; 

###### 2 

the LORD loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling places of Jacob. 

###### 3 

Glorious things of you are spoken, O city of God. Selah 

###### 4 

Among those who know me I mention Rahab and Babylon; behold, Philistia and Tyre, with Cush-- "This one was born there," they say. 

###### 5 

And of Zion it shall be said, "This one and that one were born in her"; for the Most High himself will establish her. 

###### 6 

The LORD records as he registers the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah 

###### 7 

Singers and dancers alike say, "All my springs are in you."
