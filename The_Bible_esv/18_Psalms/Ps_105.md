###### 1 

Oh give thanks to the LORD; call upon his name; make known his deeds among the peoples! 

###### 2 

Sing to him, sing praises to him; tell of all his wondrous works! 

###### 3 

Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice! 

###### 4 

Seek the LORD and his strength; seek his presence continually! 

###### 5 

Remember the wondrous works that he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he uttered, 

###### 6 

O offspring of Abraham, his servant, children of Jacob, his chosen ones! 

###### 7 

He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth. 

###### 8 

He remembers his covenant forever, the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations, 

###### 9 

the covenant that he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac, 

###### 10 

which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant, 

###### 11 

saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance." 

###### 12 

When they were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it, 

###### 13 

wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people, 

###### 14 

he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account, 

###### 15 

saying, "Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm!" 

###### 16 

When he summoned a famine on the land and broke all supply of bread, 

###### 17 

he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave. 

###### 18 

His feet were hurt with fetters; his neck was put in a collar of iron; 

###### 19 

until what he had said came to pass, the word of the LORD tested him. 

###### 20 

The king sent and released him; the ruler of the peoples set him free; 

###### 21 

he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his possessions, 

###### 22 

to bind his princes at his pleasure and to teach his elders wisdom. 

###### 23 

Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 

###### 24 

And the LORD made his people very fruitful and made them stronger than their foes. 

###### 25 

He turned their hearts to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants. 

###### 26 

He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen. 

###### 27 

They performed his signs among them and miracles in the land of Ham. 

###### 28 

He sent darkness, and made the land dark; they did not rebel against his words. 

###### 29 

He turned their waters into blood and caused their fish to die. 

###### 30 

Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings. 

###### 31 

He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country. 

###### 32 

He gave them hail for rain, and fiery lightning bolts through their land. 

###### 33 

He struck down their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country. 

###### 34 

He spoke, and the locusts came, young locusts without number, 

###### 35 

which devoured all the vegetation in their land and ate up the fruit of their ground. 

###### 36 

He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their strength. 

###### 37 

Then he brought out Israel with silver and gold, and there was none among his tribes who stumbled. 

###### 38 

Egypt was glad when they departed, for dread of them had fallen upon it. 

###### 39 

He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light by night. 

###### 40 

They asked, and he brought quail, and gave them bread from heaven in abundance. 

###### 41 

He opened the rock, and water gushed out; it flowed through the desert like a river. 

###### 42 

For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham, his servant. 

###### 43 

So he brought his people out with joy, his chosen ones with singing. 

###### 44 

And he gave them the lands of the nations, and they took possession of the fruit of the peoples' toil, 

###### 45 

that they might keep his statutes and observe his laws. Praise the LORD!
