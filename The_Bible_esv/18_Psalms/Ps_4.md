###### 1 

Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have given me relief when I was in distress. Be gracious to me and hear my prayer! 

###### 2 

O men, how long shall my honor be turned into shame? How long will you love vain words and seek after lies? Selah 

###### 3 

But know that the LORD has set apart the godly for himself; the LORD hears when I call to him. 

###### 4 

Be angry, and do not sin; ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. Selah 

###### 5 

Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the LORD. 

###### 6 

There are many who say, "Who will show us some good? Lift up the light of your face upon us, O LORD!" 

###### 7 

You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and wine abound. 

###### 8 

In peace I will both lie down and sleep; for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.
