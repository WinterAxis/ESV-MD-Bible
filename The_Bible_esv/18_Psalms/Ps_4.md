###### 1 


Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have given me relief when I was in distress. Be gracious to me and hear my prayer! 





###### 2 


O men, how long shall my honor be turned into shame? How long will you love vain words and seek after lies? Selah 





###### 3 


But know that the LORD has set apart the godly for himself; the LORD hears when I call to him. 





###### 4 


Be angry, and do not sin; ponder in your own hearts on your beds, and be silent. Selah 





###### 5 


Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the LORD. 





###### 6 


There are many who say, "Who will show us some good? Lift up the light of your face upon us, O LORD!" 





###### 7 


You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and wine abound. 





###### 8 


In peace I will both lie down and sleep; for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
