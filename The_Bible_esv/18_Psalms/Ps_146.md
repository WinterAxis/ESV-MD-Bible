###### 1 

Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD, O my soul! 

###### 2 

I will praise the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being. 

###### 3 

Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man, in whom there is no salvation. 

###### 4 

When his breath departs, he returns to the earth; on that very day his plans perish. 

###### 5 

Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God, 

###### 6 

who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, who keeps faith forever; 

###### 7 

who executes justice for the oppressed, who gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets the prisoners free; 

###### 8 

the LORD opens the eyes of the blind. The LORD lifts up those who are bowed down; the LORD loves the righteous. 

###### 9 

The LORD watches over the sojourners; he upholds the widow and the fatherless, but the way of the wicked he brings to ruin. 

###### 10 

The LORD will reign forever, your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise the LORD!
