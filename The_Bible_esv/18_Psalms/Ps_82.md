***

###### 1 

God has taken his place in the divine council; in the midst of the gods he holds judgment: 

###### 2 

"How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah 

###### 3 

Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute. 

###### 4 

Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked." 

###### 5 

They have neither knowledge nor understanding, they walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken. 

###### 6 

I said, "You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you; 

###### 7 

nevertheless, like men you shall die, and fall like any prince." 

###### 8 

Arise, O God, judge the earth; for you shall inherit all the nations!
