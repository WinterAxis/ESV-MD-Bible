###### 1 


God has taken his place in the divine council; in the midst of the gods he holds judgment: 





###### 2 


"How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Selah 





###### 3 


Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute. 





###### 4 


Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked." 





###### 5 


They have neither knowledge nor understanding, they walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken. 





###### 6 


I said, "You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you; 





###### 7 


nevertheless, like men you shall die, and fall like any prince." 





###### 8 


Arise, O God, judge the earth; for you shall inherit all the nations! ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
