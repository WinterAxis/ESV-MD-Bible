***

###### 1 

The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 

###### 2 

He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. 

###### 3 

He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. 

###### 4 

Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. 

###### 5 

You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 

###### 6 

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD forever.
