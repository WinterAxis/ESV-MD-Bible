###### 1 

When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream. 



###### 2 

Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with shouts of joy; then they said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them." 



###### 3 

The LORD has done great things for us; we are glad. 



###### 4 

Restore our fortunes, O LORD, like streams in the Negeb! 



###### 5 

Those who sow in tears shall reap with shouts of joy! 



###### 6 

He who goes out weeping, bearing the seed for sowing, shall come home with shouts of joy, bringing his sheaves with him. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
