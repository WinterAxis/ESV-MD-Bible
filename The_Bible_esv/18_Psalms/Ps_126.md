***

###### 1 

When the LORD restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream. 

###### 2 

Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with shouts of joy; then they said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them." 

###### 3 

The LORD has done great things for us; we are glad. 

###### 4 

Restore our fortunes, O LORD, like streams in the Negeb! 

###### 5 

Those who sow in tears shall reap with shouts of joy! 

###### 6 

He who goes out weeping, bearing the seed for sowing, shall come home with shouts of joy, bringing his sheaves with him.
