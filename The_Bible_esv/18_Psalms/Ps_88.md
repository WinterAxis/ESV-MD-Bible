###### 1 

O LORD, God of my salvation, I cry out day and night before you. 

###### 2 

Let my prayer come before you; incline your ear to my cry! 

###### 3 

For my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near to Sheol. 

###### 4 

I am counted among those who go down to the pit; I am a man who has no strength, 

###### 5 

like one set loose among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, like those whom you remember no more, for they are cut off from your hand. 

###### 6 

You have put me in the depths of the pit, in the regions dark and deep. 

###### 7 

Your wrath lies heavy upon me, and you overwhelm me with all your waves. Selah 

###### 8 

You have caused my companions to shun me; you have made me a horror to them. I am shut in so that I cannot escape; 

###### 9 

my eye grows dim through sorrow. Every day I call upon you, O LORD; I spread out my hands to you. 

###### 10 

Do you work wonders for the dead? Do the departed rise up to praise you? Selah 

###### 11 

Is your steadfast love declared in the grave, or your faithfulness in Abaddon? 

###### 12 

Are your wonders known in the darkness, or your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 

###### 13 

But I, O LORD, cry to you; in the morning my prayer comes before you. 

###### 14 

O LORD, why do you cast my soul away? Why do you hide your face from me? 

###### 15 

Afflicted and close to death from my youth up, I suffer your terrors; I am helpless. 

###### 16 

Your wrath has swept over me; your dreadful assaults destroy me. 

###### 17 

They surround me like a flood all day long; they close in on me together. 

###### 18 

You have caused my beloved and my friend to shun me; my companions have become darkness.
