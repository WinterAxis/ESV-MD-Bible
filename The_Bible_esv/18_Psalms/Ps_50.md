###### 1 


The Mighty One, God the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting. 





###### 2 


Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth. 





###### 3 


Our God comes; he does not keep silence; before him is a devouring fire, around him a mighty tempest. 





###### 4 


He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he may judge his people: 





###### 5 


"Gather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!" 





###### 6 


The heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge! Selah 





###### 7 


"Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your God. 





###### 8 


Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you; your burnt offerings are continually before me. 





###### 9 


I will not accept a bull from your house or goats from your folds. 





###### 10 


For every beast of the forest is mine, the cattle on a thousand hills. 





###### 11 


I know all the birds of the hills, and all that moves in the field is mine. 





###### 12 


"If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are mine. 





###### 13 


Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats? 





###### 14 


Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and perform your vows to the Most High, 





###### 15 


and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me." 





###### 16 


But to the wicked God says: "What right have you to recite my statutes or take my covenant on your lips? 





###### 17 


For you hate discipline, and you cast my words behind you. 





###### 18 


If you see a thief, you are pleased with him, and you keep company with adulterers. 





###### 19 


"You give your mouth free rein for evil, and your tongue frames deceit. 





###### 20 


You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son. 





###### 21 


These things you have done, and I have been silent; you thought that I was one like yourself. But now I rebuke you and lay the charge before you. 





###### 22 


"Mark this, then, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart, and there be none to deliver! 





###### 23 


The one who offers thanksgiving as his sacrifice glorifies me; to one who orders his way rightly I will show the salvation of God!" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
