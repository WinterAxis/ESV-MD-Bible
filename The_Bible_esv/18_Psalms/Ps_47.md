###### 1 

Clap your hands, all peoples! Shout to God with loud songs of joy! 

###### 2 

For the LORD, the Most High, is to be feared, a great king over all the earth. 

###### 3 

He subdued peoples under us, and nations under our feet. 

###### 4 

He chose our heritage for us, the pride of Jacob whom he loves. Selah 

###### 5 

God has gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet. 

###### 6 

Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our King, sing praises! 

###### 7 

For God is the King of all the earth; sing praises with a psalm! 

###### 8 

God reigns over the nations; God sits on his holy throne. 

###### 9 

The princes of the peoples gather as the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God; he is highly exalted!
