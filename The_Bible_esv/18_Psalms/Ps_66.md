###### 1 

Shout for joy to God, all the earth; 

###### 2 

sing the glory of his name; give to him glorious praise! 

###### 3 

Say to God, "How awesome are your deeds! So great is your power that your enemies come cringing to you. 

###### 4 

All the earth worships you and sings praises to you; they sing praises to your name." Selah 

###### 5 

Come and see what God has done: he is awesome in his deeds toward the children of man. 

###### 6 

He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the river on foot. There did we rejoice in him, 

###### 7 

who rules by his might forever, whose eyes keep watch on the nations-- let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah 

###### 8 

Bless our God, O peoples; let the sound of his praise be heard, 

###### 9 

who has kept our soul among the living and has not let our feet slip. 

###### 10 

For you, O God, have tested us; you have tried us as silver is tried. 

###### 11 

You brought us into the net; you laid a crushing burden on our backs; 

###### 12 

you let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; yet you have brought us out to a place of abundance. 

###### 13 

I will come into your house with burnt offerings; I will perform my vows to you, 

###### 14 

that which my lips uttered and my mouth promised when I was in trouble. 

###### 15 

I will offer to you burnt offerings of fattened animals, with the smoke of the sacrifice of rams; I will make an offering of bulls and goats. Selah 

###### 16 

Come and hear, all you who fear God, and I will tell what he has done for my soul. 

###### 17 

I cried to him with my mouth, and high praise was on my tongue. 

###### 18 

If I had cherished iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not have listened. 

###### 19 

But truly God has listened; he has attended to the voice of my prayer. 

###### 20 

Blessed be God, because he has not rejected my prayer or removed his steadfast love from me!
