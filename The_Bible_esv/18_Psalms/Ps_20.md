###### 1 

May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble! May the name of the God of Jacob protect you! 

###### 2 

May he send you help from the sanctuary and give you support from Zion! 

###### 3 

May he remember all your offerings and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices! Selah 

###### 4 

May he grant you your heart's desire and fulfill all your plans! 

###### 5 

May we shout for joy over your salvation, and in the name of our God set up our banners! May the LORD fulfill all your petitions! 

###### 6 

Now I know that the LORD saves his anointed; he will answer him from his holy heaven with the saving might of his right hand. 

###### 7 

Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God. 

###### 8 

They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand upright. 

###### 9 

O LORD, save the king! May he answer us when we call.
