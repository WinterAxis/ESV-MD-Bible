###### 1 

To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul. 

###### 2 

O my God, in you I trust; let me not be put to shame; let not my enemies exult over me. 

###### 3 

Indeed, none who wait for you shall be put to shame; they shall be ashamed who are wantonly treacherous. 

###### 4 

Make me to know your ways, O LORD; teach me your paths. 

###### 5 

Lead me in your truth and teach me, for you are the God of my salvation; for you I wait all the day long. 

###### 6 

Remember your mercy, O LORD, and your steadfast love, for they have been from of old. 

###### 7 

Remember not the sins of my youth or my transgressions; according to your steadfast love remember me, for the sake of your goodness, O LORD! 

###### 8 

Good and upright is the LORD; therefore he instructs sinners in the way. 

###### 9 

He leads the humble in what is right, and teaches the humble his way. 

###### 10 

All the paths of the LORD are steadfast love and faithfulness, for those who keep his covenant and his testimonies. 

###### 11 

For your name's sake, O LORD, pardon my guilt, for it is great. 

###### 12 

Who is the man who fears the LORD? Him will he instruct in the way that he should choose. 

###### 13 

His soul shall abide in well-being, and his offspring shall inherit the land. 

###### 14 

The friendship of the LORD is for those who fear him, and he makes known to them his covenant. 

###### 15 

My eyes are ever toward the LORD, for he will pluck my feet out of the net. 

###### 16 

Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted. 

###### 17 

The troubles of my heart are enlarged; bring me out of my distresses. 

###### 18 

Consider my affliction and my trouble, and forgive all my sins. 

###### 19 

Consider how many are my foes, and with what violent hatred they hate me. 

###### 20 

Oh, guard my soul, and deliver me! Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in you. 

###### 21 

May integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for you. 

###### 22 

Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
