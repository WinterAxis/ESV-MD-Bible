***

###### 1 

The LORD says to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool." 

###### 2 

The LORD sends forth from Zion your mighty scepter. Rule in the midst of your enemies! 

###### 3 

Your people will offer themselves freely on the day of your power, in holy garments; from the womb of the morning, the dew of your youth will be yours. 

###### 4 

The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind, "You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek." 

###### 5 

The Lord is at your right hand; he will shatter kings on the day of his wrath. 

###### 6 

He will execute judgment among the nations, filling them with corpses; he will shatter chiefs over the wide earth. 

###### 7 

He will drink from the brook by the way; therefore he will lift up his head.
