###### 1 

Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need to have anything written to you. 

###### 2 

For you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. 

###### 3 

While people are saying, "There is peace and security," then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. 

###### 4 

But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief. 

###### 5 

For you are all children of light, children of the day. We are not of the night or of the darkness. 

###### 6 

So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober. 

###### 7 

For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night. 

###### 8 

But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. 

###### 9 

For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 

###### 10 

who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him. 

###### 11 

Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing. ## Final Instructions and Benediction 

###### 12 

We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, 

###### 13 

and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. 

###### 14 

And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all. 

###### 15 

See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone. 

###### 16 

Rejoice always, 

###### 17 

pray without ceasing, 

###### 18 

give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. 

###### 19 

Do not quench the Spirit. 

###### 20 

Do not despise prophecies, 

###### 21 

but test everything; hold fast what is good. 

###### 22 

Abstain from every form of evil. 

###### 23 

Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### 24 

He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it. 

###### 25 

Brothers, pray for us. 

###### 26 

Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss. 

###### 27 

I put you under oath before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers. 

###### 28 

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
