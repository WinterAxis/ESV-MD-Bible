###### 1 

Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus, 

###### 2 

To Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. ## Guard the Deposit Entrusted to You 

###### 3 

I thank God whom I serve, as did my ancestors, with a clear conscience, as I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day. 

###### 4 

As I remember your tears, I long to see you, that I may be filled with joy. 

###### 5 

I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well. 

###### 6 

For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands, 

###### 7 

for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control. 

###### 8 

Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God, 

###### 9 

who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, 

###### 10 

and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, 

###### 11 

for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher, 

###### 12 

which is why I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard until that day what has been entrusted to me. 

###### 13 

Follow the pattern of the sound words that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 

###### 14 

By the Holy Spirit who dwells within us, guard the good deposit entrusted to you. 

###### 15 

You are aware that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. 

###### 16 

May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains, 

###### 17 

but when he arrived in Rome he searched for me earnestly and found me-- 

###### 18 

may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day!--and you well know all the service he rendered at Ephesus.
