###### 1 


Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram always loved David. 





###### 2 


And Solomon sent word to Hiram, 





###### 3 


"You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet. 





###### 4 


But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side. There is neither adversary nor misfortune. 





###### 5 


And so I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD said to David my father, 'Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, shall build the house for my name.' 





###### 6 


Now therefore command that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. And my servants will join your servants, and I will pay you for your servants such wages as you set, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians." 





###### 7 


As soon as Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, "Blessed be the LORD this day, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people." 





###### 8 


And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, "I have heard the message that you have sent to me. I am ready to do all you desire in the matter of cedar and cypress timber. 





###### 9 


My servants shall bring it down to the sea from Lebanon, and I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you direct. And I will have them broken up there, and you shall receive it. And you shall meet my wishes by providing food for my household." 





###### 10 


So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the timber of cedar and cypress that he desired, 





###### 11 


while Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 cors of wheat as food for his household, and 20,000 cors of beaten oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year. 





###### 12 


And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty. 





###### 13 


King Solomon drafted forced labor out of all Israel, and the draft numbered 30,000 men. 





###### 14 


And he sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in shifts. They would be a month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the draft. 





###### 15 


Solomon also had 70,000 burden-bearers and 80,000 stonecutters in the hill country, 





###### 16 


besides Solomon's 3,300 chief officers who were over the work, who had charge of the people who carried on the work. 





###### 17 


At the king's command they quarried out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones. 





###### 18 


So Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the men of Gebal did the cutting and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
