###### 1 
Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah. 

###### 2 
She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 

###### 3 
Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 

###### 4 
The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. 

###### 5 
Abraham gave all he had to Isaac. 

###### 6 
But to the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts, and while he was still living he sent them away from his son Isaac, eastward to the east country. 

###### 7 
These are the days of the years of Abraham's life, 175 years. 

###### 8 
Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people. 

###### 9 
Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, east of Mamre, 

###### 10 
the field that Abraham purchased from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried, with Sarah his wife. 

###### 11 
After the death of Abraham, God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac settled at Beer-lahai-roi. 

###### 12 
These are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's servant, bore to Abraham. 

###### 13 
These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, named in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael; and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 

###### 14 
Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 

###### 15 
Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 

###### 16 
These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their villages and by their encampments, twelve princes according to their tribes. 

###### 17 
(These are the years of the life of Ishmael: 137 years. He breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.) 

###### 18 
They settled from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite Egypt in the direction of Assyria. He settled over against all his kinsmen. ## The Birth of Esau and Jacob 

###### 19 
These are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham fathered Isaac, 

###### 20 
and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife. 

###### 21 
And Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 

###### 22 
The children struggled together within her, and she said, "If it is thus, why is this happening to me?" So she went to inquire of the LORD. 

###### 23 
And the LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you shall be divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the older shall serve the younger." 

###### 24 
When her days to give birth were completed, behold, there were twins in her womb. 

###### 25 
The first came out red, all his body like a hairy cloak, so they called his name Esau. 

###### 26 
Afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau's heel, so his name was called Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them. 

###### 27 
When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. 

###### 28 
Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob. ## Esau Sells His Birthright 

###### 29 
Once when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the field, and he was exhausted. 

###### 30 
And Esau said to Jacob, "Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am exhausted!" (Therefore his name was called Edom.) 

###### 31 
Jacob said, "Sell me your birthright now." 

###### 32 
Esau said, "I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?" 

###### 33 
Jacob said, "Swear to me now." So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob. 

###### 34 
Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank and rose and went his way. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
