###### 1 


When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. 





###### 2 


The more they were called, the more they went away; they kept sacrificing to the Baals and burning offerings to idols. 





###### 3 


Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk; I took them up by their arms, but they did not know that I healed them. 





###### 4 


I led them with cords of kindness, with the bands of love, and I became to them as one who eases the yoke on their jaws, and I bent down to them and fed them. 





###### 5 


They shall not return to the land of Egypt, but Assyria shall be their king, because they have refused to return to me. 





###### 6 


The sword shall rage against their cities, consume the bars of their gates, and devour them because of their own counsels. 





###### 7 


My people are bent on turning away from me, and though they call out to the Most High, he shall not raise them up at all. 





###### 8 


How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart recoils within me; my compassion grows warm and tender. 





###### 9 


I will not execute my burning anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim; for I am God and not a man, the Holy One in your midst, and I will not come in wrath. 





###### 10 


They shall go after the LORD; he will roar like a lion; when he roars, his children shall come trembling from the west; 





###### 11 


they shall come trembling like birds from Egypt, and like doves from the land of Assyria, and I will return them to their homes, declares the LORD. 





###### 12 


Ephraim has surrounded me with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit, but Judah still walks with God and is faithful to the Holy One. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
