###### 1 


Hear this, O priests! Pay attention, O house of Israel! Give ear, O house of the king! For the judgment is for you; for you have been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread upon Tabor. 





###### 2 


And the revolters have gone deep into slaughter, but I will discipline all of them. 





###### 3 


I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me; for now, O Ephraim, you have played the whore; Israel is defiled. 





###### 4 


Their deeds do not permit them to return to their God. For the spirit of whoredom is within them, and they know not the LORD. 





###### 5 


The pride of Israel testifies to his face; Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in his guilt; Judah also shall stumble with them. 





###### 6 


With their flocks and herds they shall go to seek the LORD, but they will not find him; he has withdrawn from them. 





###### 7 


They have dealt faithlessly with the LORD; for they have borne alien children. Now the new moon shall devour them with their fields. 





###### 8 


Blow the horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah. Sound the alarm at Beth-aven; we follow you, O Benjamin! 





###### 9 


Ephraim shall become a desolation in the day of punishment; among the tribes of Israel I make known what is sure. 





###### 10 


The princes of Judah have become like those who move the landmark; upon them I will pour out my wrath like water. 





###### 11 


Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, because he was determined to go after filth. 





###### 12 


But I am like a moth to Ephraim, and like dry rot to the house of Judah. 





###### 13 


When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to the great king. But he is not able to cure you or heal your wound. 





###### 14 


For I will be like a lion to Ephraim, and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear and go away; I will carry off, and no one shall rescue. 





###### 15 


I will return again to my place, until they acknowledge their guilt and seek my face, and in their distress earnestly seek me. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
