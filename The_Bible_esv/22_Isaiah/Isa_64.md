###### 1 


Oh that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence-- 





###### 2 


as when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil-- to make your name known to your adversaries, and that the nations might tremble at your presence! 





###### 3 


When you did awesome things that we did not look for, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence. 





###### 4 


From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides you, who acts for those who wait for him. 





###### 5 


You meet him who joyfully works righteousness, those who remember you in your ways. Behold, you were angry, and we sinned; in our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved? 





###### 6 


We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. 





###### 7 


There is no one who calls upon your name, who rouses himself to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have made us melt in the hand of our iniquities. 





###### 8 


But now, O LORD, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand. 





###### 9 


Be not so terribly angry, O LORD, and remember not iniquity forever. Behold, please look, we are all your people. 





###### 10 


Your holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation. 





###### 11 


Our holy and beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, has been burned by fire, and all our pleasant places have become ruins. 





###### 12 


Will you restrain yourself at these things, O LORD? Will you keep silent, and afflict us so terribly? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
