###### 1 


Ah, Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let the feasts run their round. 





###### 2 


Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be moaning and lamentation, and she shall be to me like an Ariel. 





###### 3 


And I will encamp against you all around, and will besiege you with towers and I will raise siegeworks against you. 





###### 4 


And you will be brought low; from the earth you shall speak, and from the dust your speech will be bowed down; your voice shall come from the ground like the voice of a ghost, and from the dust your speech shall whisper. 





###### 5 


But the multitude of your foreign foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the ruthless like passing chaff. And in an instant, suddenly, 





###### 6 


you will be visited by the LORD of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire. 





###### 7 


And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, all that fight against her and her stronghold and distress her, shall be like a dream, a vision of the night. 





###### 8 


As when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he is eating, and awakes with his hunger not satisfied, or as when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he is drinking, and awakes faint, with his thirst not quenched, so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against Mount Zion. 





###### 9 


Astonish yourselves and be astonished; blind yourselves and be blind! Be drunk, but not with wine; stagger, but not with strong drink! 





###### 10 


For the LORD has poured out upon you a spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes (the prophets), and covered your heads (the seers). 





###### 11 


And the vision of all this has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed. When men give it to one who can read, saying, "Read this," he says, "I cannot, for it is sealed." 





###### 12 


And when they give the book to one who cannot read, saying, "Read this," he says, "I cannot read." 





###### 13 


And the Lord said: "Because this people draw near with their mouth and honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment taught by men, 





###### 14 


therefore, behold, I will again do wonderful things with this people, with wonder upon wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the discernment of their discerning men shall be hidden." 





###### 15 


Ah, you who hide deep from the LORD your counsel, whose deeds are in the dark, and who say, "Who sees us? Who knows us?" 





###### 16 


You turn things upside down! Shall the potter be regarded as the clay, that the thing made should say of its maker, "He did not make me"; or the thing formed say of him who formed it, "He has no understanding"? 





###### 17 


Is it not yet a very little while until Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be regarded as a forest? 





###### 18 


In that day the deaf shall hear the words of a book, and out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see. 





###### 19 


The meek shall obtain fresh joy in the LORD, and the poor among mankind shall exult in the Holy One of Israel. 





###### 20 


For the ruthless shall come to nothing and the scoffer cease, and all who watch to do evil shall be cut off, 





###### 21 


who by a word make a man out to be an offender, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and with an empty plea turn aside him who is in the right. 





###### 22 


Therefore thus says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: "Jacob shall no more be ashamed, no more shall his face grow pale. 





###### 23 


For when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in his midst, they will sanctify my name; they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob and will stand in awe of the God of Israel. 





###### 24 


And those who go astray in spirit will come to understanding, and those who murmur will accept instruction." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
