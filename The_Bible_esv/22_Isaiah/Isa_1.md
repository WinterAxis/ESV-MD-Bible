###### 1 


The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. ## The Wickedness of Judah 





###### 2 


Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the LORD has spoken: "Children have I reared and brought up, but they have rebelled against me. 





###### 3 


The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master's crib, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand." 





###### 4 


Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, offspring of evildoers, children who deal corruptly! They have forsaken the LORD, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are utterly estranged. 





###### 5 


Why will you still be struck down? Why will you continue to rebel? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. 





###### 6 


From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it, but bruises and sores and raw wounds; they are not pressed out or bound up or softened with oil. 





###### 7 


Your country lies desolate; your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence foreigners devour your land; it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners. 





###### 8 


And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a lodge in a cucumber field, like a besieged city. 





###### 9 


If the LORD of hosts had not left us a few survivors, we should have been like Sodom, and become like Gomorrah. 





###### 10 


Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom! Give ear to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah! 





###### 11 


"What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the LORD; I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed beasts; I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats. 





###### 12 


"When you come to appear before me, who has required of you this trampling of my courts? 





###### 13 


Bring no more vain offerings; incense is an abomination to me. New moon and Sabbath and the calling of convocations-- I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly. 





###### 14 


Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates; they have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them. 





###### 15 


When you spread out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood. 





###### 16 


Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes; cease to do evil, 





###### 17 


learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause. 





###### 18 


"Come now, let us reason together, says the LORD: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool. 





###### 19 


If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land; 





###### 20 


but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be eaten by the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken." ## The Unfaithful City 





###### 21 


How the faithful city has become a whore, she who was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers. 





###### 22 


Your silver has become dross, your best wine mixed with water. 





###### 23 


Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bribe and runs after gifts. They do not bring justice to the fatherless, and the widow's cause does not come to them. 





###### 24 


Therefore the Lord declares, the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: "Ah, I will get relief from my enemies and avenge myself on my foes. 





###### 25 


I will turn my hand against you and will smelt away your dross as with lye and remove all your alloy. 





###### 26 


And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city." 





###### 27 


Zion shall be redeemed by justice, and those in her who repent, by righteousness. 





###### 28 


But rebels and sinners shall be broken together, and those who forsake the LORD shall be consumed. 





###### 29 


For they shall be ashamed of the oaks that you desired; and you shall blush for the gardens that you have chosen. 





###### 30 


For you shall be like an oak whose leaf withers, and like a garden without water. 





###### 31 


And the strong shall become tinder, and his work a spark, and both of them shall burn together, with none to quench them. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
