###### 1 


The oracle concerning Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw. 





###### 2 


On a bare hill raise a signal; cry aloud to them; wave the hand for them to enter the gates of the nobles. 





###### 3 


I myself have commanded my consecrated ones, and have summoned my mighty men to execute my anger, my proudly exulting ones. 





###### 4 


The sound of a tumult is on the mountains as of a great multitude! The sound of an uproar of kingdoms, of nations gathering together! The LORD of hosts is mustering a host for battle. 





###### 5 


They come from a distant land, from the end of the heavens, the LORD and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land. 





###### 6 


Wail, for the day of the LORD is near; as destruction from the Almighty it will come! 





###### 7 


Therefore all hands will be feeble, and every human heart will melt. 





###### 8 


They will be dismayed: pangs and agony will seize them; they will be in anguish like a woman in labor. They will look aghast at one another; their faces will be aflame. 





###### 9 


Behold, the day of the LORD comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger, to make the land a desolation and to destroy its sinners from it. 





###### 10 


For the stars of the heavens and their constellations will not give their light; the sun will be dark at its rising, and the moon will not shed its light. 





###### 11 


I will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; I will put an end to the pomp of the arrogant, and lay low the pompous pride of the ruthless. 





###### 12 


I will make people more rare than fine gold, and mankind than the gold of Ophir. 





###### 13 


Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken out of its place, at the wrath of the LORD of hosts in the day of his fierce anger. 





###### 14 


And like a hunted gazelle, or like sheep with none to gather them, each will turn to his own people, and each will flee to his own land. 





###### 15 


Whoever is found will be thrust through, and whoever is caught will fall by the sword. 





###### 16 


Their infants will be dashed in pieces before their eyes; their houses will be plundered and their wives ravished. 





###### 17 


Behold, I am stirring up the Medes against them, who have no regard for silver and do not delight in gold. 





###### 18 


Their bows will slaughter the young men; they will have no mercy on the fruit of the womb; their eyes will not pity children. 





###### 19 


And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the splendor and pomp of the Chaldeans, will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them. 





###### 20 


It will never be inhabited or lived in for all generations; no Arab will pitch his tent there; no shepherds will make their flocks lie down there. 





###### 21 


But wild animals will lie down there, and their houses will be full of howling creatures; there ostriches will dwell, and there wild goats will dance. 





###### 22 


Hyenas will cry in its towers, and jackals in the pleasant palaces; its time is close at hand and its days will not be prolonged. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
