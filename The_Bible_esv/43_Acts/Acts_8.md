###### 1 


And Saul approved of his execution. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. 





###### 2 


Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him. 





###### 3 


But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison. ## Philip Proclaims Christ in Samaria 





###### 4 


Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word. 





###### 5 


Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ. 





###### 6 


And the crowds with one accord paid attention to what was being said by Philip, when they heard him and saw the signs that he did. 





###### 7 


For unclean spirits, crying out with a loud voice, came out of many who had them, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. 





###### 8 


So there was much joy in that city. ## Simon the Magician Believes 





###### 9 


But there was a man named Simon, who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was somebody great. 





###### 10 


They all paid attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is the power of God that is called Great." 





###### 11 


And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic. 





###### 12 


But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. 





###### 13 


Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed. 





###### 14 


Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, 





###### 15 


who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, 





###### 16 


for he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 





###### 17 


Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. 





###### 18 


Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, 





###### 19 


saying, "Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit." 





###### 20 


But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! 





###### 21 


You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God. 





###### 22 


Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you. 





###### 23 


For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity." 





###### 24 


And Simon answered, "Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me." 





###### 25 


Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans. ## Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch 





###### 26 


Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." This is a desert place. 





###### 27 


And he rose and went. And there was an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship 





###### 28 


and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah. 





###### 29 


And the Spirit said to Philip, "Go over and join this chariot." 





###### 30 


So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, "Do you understand what you are reading?" 





###### 31 


And he said, "How can I, unless someone guides me?" And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. 





###### 32 


Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this: "Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he opens not his mouth. 





###### 33 


In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth." 





###### 34 


And the eunuch said to Philip, "About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?" 





###### 35 


Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus. 





###### 36 


And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "See, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?" 





###### 38 


And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. 





###### 39 


And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing. 





###### 40 


But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
