###### 1 


Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed. 





###### 2 


But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers. 





###### 3 


So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. 





###### 4 


But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews and some with the apostles. 





###### 5 


When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to mistreat them and to stone them, 





###### 6 


they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding country, 





###### 7 


and there they continued to preach the gospel. ## Paul and Barnabas at Lystra 





###### 8 


Now at Lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet. He was crippled from birth and had never walked. 





###### 9 


He listened to Paul speaking. And Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well, 





###### 10 


said in a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet." And he sprang up and began walking. 





###### 11 


And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, "The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!" 





###### 12 


Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. 





###### 13 


And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds. 





###### 14 


But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd, crying out, 





###### 15 


"Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men, of like nature with you, and we bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them. 





###### 16 


In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways. 





###### 17 


Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness." 





###### 18 


Even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them. ## Paul Stoned at Lystra 





###### 19 


But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. 





###### 20 


But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city, and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe. 





###### 21 


When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, 





###### 22 


strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God. 





###### 23 


And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed. ## Paul and Barnabas Return to Antioch in Syria 





###### 24 


Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. 





###### 25 


And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, 





###### 26 


and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had fulfilled. 





###### 27 


And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. 





###### 28 


And they remained no little time with the disciples. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
