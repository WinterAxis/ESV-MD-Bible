###### 1 


Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. 





###### 2 


So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him, saying, 





###### 3 


"You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them." 





###### 4 


But Peter began and explained it to them in order: 





###### 5 


"I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me. 





###### 6 


Looking at it closely, I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air. 





###### 7 


And I heard a voice saying to me, **'Rise, Peter; kill and eat.'** 





###### 8 


But I said, 'By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.' 





###### 9 


But the voice answered a second time from heaven, **'What God has made clean, do not call common.'** 





###### 10 


This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven. 





###### 11 


And behold, at that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesarea. 





###### 12 


And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house. 





###### 13 


And he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say, 'Send to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter; 





###### 14 


he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.' 





###### 15 


As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning. 





###### 16 


And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, **'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'** 





###### 17 


If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God's way?" 





###### 18 


When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, "Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life." ## The Church in Antioch 





###### 19 


Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews. 





###### 20 


But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus. 





###### 21 


And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord. 





###### 22 


The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. 





###### 23 


When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose, 





###### 24 


for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord. 





###### 25 


So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, 





###### 26 


and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians. 





###### 27 


Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. 





###### 28 


And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world (this took place in the days of Claudius). 





###### 29 


So the disciples determined, every one according to his ability, to send relief to the brothers living in Judea. 





###### 30 


And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
