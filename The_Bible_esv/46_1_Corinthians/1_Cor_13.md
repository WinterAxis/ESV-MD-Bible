###### 1 
If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 

###### 2 
And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 

###### 3 
If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. 

###### 4 
Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant 

###### 5 
or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; 

###### 6 
it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. 

###### 7 
Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. 

###### 8 
Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. 

###### 9 
For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 

###### 10 
but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. 

###### 11 
When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. 

###### 12 
For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known. 

###### 13 
So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
