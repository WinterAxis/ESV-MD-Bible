###### 1 


Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish, 





###### 2 


saying, "I called out to the LORD, out of my distress, and he answered me; out of the belly of Sheol I cried, and you heard my voice. 





###### 3 


For you cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the flood surrounded me; all your waves and your billows passed over me. 





###### 4 


Then I said, 'I am driven away from your sight; yet I shall again look upon your holy temple.' 





###### 5 


The waters closed in over me to take my life; the deep surrounded me; weeds were wrapped about my head 





###### 6 


at the roots of the mountains. I went down to the land whose bars closed upon me forever; yet you brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God. 





###### 7 


When my life was fainting away, I remembered the LORD, and my prayer came to you, into your holy temple. 





###### 8 


Those who pay regard to vain idols forsake their hope of steadfast love. 





###### 9 


But I with the voice of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you; what I have vowed I will pay. Salvation belongs to the LORD!" 





###### 10 


And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
