###### 1 

"Behold, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it. 

###### 2 

What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you. 

###### 3 

But I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue my case with God. 

###### 4 

As for you, you whitewash with lies; worthless physicians are you all. 

###### 5 

Oh that you would keep silent, and it would be your wisdom! 

###### 6 

Hear now my argument and listen to the pleadings of my lips. 

###### 7 

Will you speak falsely for God and speak deceitfully for him? 

###### 8 

Will you show partiality toward him? Will you plead the case for God? 

###### 9 

Will it be well with you when he searches you out? Or can you deceive him, as one deceives a man? 

###### 10 

He will surely rebuke you if in secret you show partiality. 

###### 11 

Will not his majesty terrify you, and the dread of him fall upon you? 

###### 12 

Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay. 

###### 13 

"Let me have silence, and I will speak, and let come on me what may. 

###### 14 

Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand? 

###### 15 

Though he slay me, I will hope in him; yet I will argue my ways to his face. 

###### 16 

This will be my salvation, that the godless shall not come before him. 

###### 17 

Keep listening to my words, and let my declaration be in your ears. 

###### 18 

Behold, I have prepared my case; I know that I shall be in the right. 

###### 19 

Who is there who will contend with me? For then I would be silent and die. 

###### 20 

Only grant me two things, then I will not hide myself from your face: 

###### 21 

withdraw your hand far from me, and let not dread of you terrify me. 

###### 22 

Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and you reply to me. 

###### 23 

How many are my iniquities and my sins? Make me know my transgression and my sin. 

###### 24 

Why do you hide your face and count me as your enemy? 

###### 25 

Will you frighten a driven leaf and pursue dry chaff? 

###### 26 

For you write bitter things against me and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth. 

###### 27 

You put my feet in the stocks and watch all my paths; you set a limit for the soles of my feet. 

###### 28 

Man wastes away like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.
