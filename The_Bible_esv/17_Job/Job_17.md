###### 1 


"My spirit is broken; my days are extinct; the graveyard is ready for me. 





###### 2 


Surely there are mockers about me, and my eye dwells on their provocation. 





###### 3 


"Lay down a pledge for me with you; who is there who will put up security for me? 





###### 4 


Since you have closed their hearts to understanding, therefore you will not let them triumph. 





###### 5 


He who informs against his friends to get a share of their property-- the eyes of his children will fail. 





###### 6 


"He has made me a byword of the peoples, and I am one before whom men spit. 





###### 7 


My eye has grown dim from vexation, and all my members are like a shadow. 





###### 8 


The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent stirs himself up against the godless. 





###### 9 


Yet the righteous holds to his way, and he who has clean hands grows stronger and stronger. 





###### 10 


But you, come on again, all of you, and I shall not find a wise man among you. 





###### 11 


My days are past; my plans are broken off, the desires of my heart. 





###### 12 


They make night into day: 'The light,' they say, 'is near to the darkness.' 





###### 13 


If I hope for Sheol as my house, if I make my bed in darkness, 





###### 14 


if I say to the pit, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother,' or 'My sister,' 





###### 15 


where then is my hope? Who will see my hope? 





###### 16 


Will it go down to the bars of Sheol? Shall we descend together into the dust?" ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
