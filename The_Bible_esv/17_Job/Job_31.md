###### 1 


"I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I gaze at a virgin? 





###### 2 


What would be my portion from God above and my heritage from the Almighty on high? 





###### 3 


Is not calamity for the unrighteous, and disaster for the workers of iniquity? 





###### 4 


Does not he see my ways and number all my steps? 





###### 5 


"If I have walked with falsehood and my foot has hastened to deceit; 





###### 6 


(Let me be weighed in a just balance, and let God know my integrity!) 





###### 7 


if my step has turned aside from the way and my heart has gone after my eyes, and if any spot has stuck to my hands, 





###### 8 


then let me sow, and another eat, and let what grows for me be rooted out. 





###### 9 


"If my heart has been enticed toward a woman, and I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door, 





###### 10 


then let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down on her. 





###### 11 


For that would be a heinous crime; that would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges; 





###### 12 


for that would be a fire that consumes as far as Abaddon, and it would burn to the root all my increase. 





###### 13 


"If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant, when they brought a complaint against me, 





###### 14 


what then shall I do when God rises up? When he makes inquiry, what shall I answer him? 





###### 15 


Did not he who made me in the womb make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb? 





###### 16 


"If I have withheld anything that the poor desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail, 





###### 17 


or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten of it 





###### 18 


(for from my youth the fatherless grew up with me as with a father, and from my mother's womb I guided the widow), 





###### 19 


if I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, or the needy without covering, 





###### 20 


if his body has not blessed me, and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep, 





###### 21 


if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate, 





###### 22 


then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder, and let my arm be broken from its socket. 





###### 23 


For I was in terror of calamity from God, and I could not have faced his majesty. 





###### 24 


"If I have made gold my trust or called fine gold my confidence, 





###### 25 


if I have rejoiced because my wealth was abundant or because my hand had found much, 





###### 26 


if I have looked at the sun when it shone, or the moon moving in splendor, 





###### 27 


and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand, 





###### 28 


this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges, for I would have been false to God above. 





###### 29 


"If I have rejoiced at the ruin of him who hated me, or exulted when evil overtook him 





###### 30 


(I have not let my mouth sin by asking for his life with a curse), 





###### 31 


if the men of my tent have not said, 'Who is there that has not been filled with his meat?' 





###### 32 


(the sojourner has not lodged in the street; I have opened my doors to the traveler), 





###### 33 


if I have concealed my transgressions as others do by hiding my iniquity in my heart, 





###### 34 


because I stood in great fear of the multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and did not go out of doors-- 





###### 35 


Oh, that I had one to hear me! (Here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me!) Oh, that I had the indictment written by my adversary! 





###### 36 


Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; I would bind it on me as a crown; 





###### 37 


I would give him an account of all my steps; like a prince I would approach him. 





###### 38 


"If my land has cried out against me and its furrows have wept together, 





###### 39 


if I have eaten its yield without payment and made its owners breathe their last, 





###### 40 


let thorns grow instead of wheat, and foul weeds instead of barley."
