###### 1 


Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: 





###### 2 


"If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? Yet who can keep from speaking? 





###### 3 


Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands. 





###### 4 


Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have made firm the feeble knees. 





###### 5 


But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it touches you, and you are dismayed. 





###### 6 


Is not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope? 





###### 7 


"Remember: who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off? 





###### 8 


As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same. 





###### 9 


By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed. 





###### 10 


The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions are broken. 





###### 11

###### 12 


"Now a word was brought to me stealthily; my ear received the whisper of it. 





###### 13 


Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, 





###### 14 


dread came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake. 





###### 15 


A spirit glided past my face; the hair of my flesh stood up. 





###### 16 


It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, then I heard a voice: 





###### 17 


'Can mortal man be in the right before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker? 





###### 18 


Even in his servants he puts no trust, and his angels he charges with error; 





###### 19 


how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like the moth. 





###### 20 


Between morning and evening they are beaten to pieces; they perish forever without anyone regarding it. 





###### 21 


Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them, do they not die, and that without wisdom?' ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
