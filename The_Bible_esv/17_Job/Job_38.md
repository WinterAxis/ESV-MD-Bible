###### 1 


Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said: 





###### 2 


"Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? 





###### 3 


Dress for action like a man; I will question you, and you make it known to me. 





###### 4 


"Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding. 





###### 5 


Who determined its measurements--surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it? 





###### 6 


On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone, 





###### 7 


when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy? 





###### 8 


"Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb, 





###### 9 


when I made clouds its garment and thick darkness its swaddling band, 





###### 10 


and prescribed limits for it and set bars and doors, 





###### 11 


and said, 'Thus far shall you come, and no farther, and here shall your proud waves be stayed'? 





###### 12 


"Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place, 





###### 13 


that it might take hold of the skirts of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it? 





###### 14 


It is changed like clay under the seal, and its features stand out like a garment. 





###### 15 


From the wicked their light is withheld, and their uplifted arm is broken. 





###### 16 


"Have you entered into the springs of the sea, or walked in the recesses of the deep? 





###### 17 


Have the gates of death been revealed to you, or have you seen the gates of deep darkness? 





###### 18 


Have you comprehended the expanse of the earth? Declare, if you know all this. 





###### 19 


"Where is the way to the dwelling of light, and where is the place of darkness, 





###### 20 


that you may take it to its territory and that you may discern the paths to its home? 





###### 21 


You know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great! 





###### 22 


"Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the storehouses of the hail, 





###### 23 


which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war? 





###### 24 


What is the way to the place where the light is distributed, or where the east wind is scattered upon the earth? 





###### 25 


"Who has cleft a channel for the torrents of rain and a way for the thunderbolt, 





###### 26 


to bring rain on a land where no man is, on the desert in which there is no man, 





###### 27 


to satisfy the waste and desolate land, and to make the ground sprout with grass? 





###### 28 


"Has the rain a father, or who has begotten the drops of dew? 





###### 29 


From whose womb did the ice come forth, and who has given birth to the frost of heaven? 





###### 30 


The waters become hard like stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. 





###### 31 


"Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loose the cords of Orion? 





###### 32 


Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season, or can you guide the Bear with its children? 





###### 33 


Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you establish their rule on the earth? 





###### 34 


"Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, that a flood of waters may cover you? 





###### 35 


Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go and say to you, 'Here we are'? 





###### 36 


Who has put wisdom in the inward parts or given understanding to the mind? 





###### 37 


Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens, 





###### 38 


when the dust runs into a mass and the clods stick fast together? 





###### 39 


"Can you hunt the prey for the lion, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions, 





###### 40 


when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in their thicket? 





###### 41 


Who provides for the raven its prey, when its young ones cry to God for help, and wander about for lack of food? ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
