###### 1 

Then Job answered and said: 

###### 2 

"Today also my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy on account of my groaning. 

###### 3 

Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his seat! 

###### 4 

I would lay my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments. 

###### 5 

I would know what he would answer me and understand what he would say to me. 

###### 6 

Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; he would pay attention to me. 

###### 7 

There an upright man could argue with him, and I would be acquitted forever by my judge. 

###### 8 

"Behold, I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I do not perceive him; 

###### 9 

on the left hand when he is working, I do not behold him; he turns to the right hand, but I do not see him. 

###### 10 

But he knows the way that I take; when he has tried me, I shall come out as gold. 

###### 11 

My foot has held fast to his steps; I have kept his way and have not turned aside. 

###### 12 

I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my portion of food. 

###### 13 

But he is unchangeable, and who can turn him back? What he desires, that he does. 

###### 14 

For he will complete what he appoints for me, and many such things are in his mind. 

###### 15 

Therefore I am terrified at his presence; when I consider, I am in dread of him. 

###### 16 

God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me; 

###### 17 

yet I am not silenced because of the darkness, nor because thick darkness covers my face.
