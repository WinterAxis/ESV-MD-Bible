###### 1 

And the LORD said to Job: 

###### 2 

"Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it." ## Job Promises Silence 

###### 3 

Then Job answered the LORD and said: 

###### 4 

"Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth. 

###### 5 

I have spoken once, and I will not answer; twice, but I will proceed no further." ## The LORD Challenges Job 

###### 6 

Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said: 

###### 7 

"Dress for action like a man; I will question you, and you make it known to me. 

###### 8 

Will you even put me in the wrong? Will you condemn me that you may be in the right? 

###### 9 

Have you an arm like God, and can you thunder with a voice like his? 

###### 10 

"Adorn yourself with majesty and dignity; clothe yourself with glory and splendor. 

###### 11 

Pour out the overflowings of your anger, and look on everyone who is proud and abase him. 

###### 12 

Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low and tread down the wicked where they stand. 

###### 13 

Hide them all in the dust together; bind their faces in the world below. 

###### 14 

Then will I also acknowledge to you that your own right hand can save you. 

###### 15 

"Behold, Behemoth, which I made as I made you; he eats grass like an ox. 

###### 16 

Behold, his strength in his loins, and his power in the muscles of his belly. 

###### 17 

He makes his tail stiff like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together. 

###### 18 

His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like bars of iron. 

###### 19 

"He is the first of the works of God; let him who made him bring near his sword! 

###### 20 

For the mountains yield food for him where all the wild beasts play. 

###### 21 

Under the lotus plants he lies, in the shelter of the reeds and in the marsh. 

###### 22 

For his shade the lotus trees cover him; the willows of the brook surround him. 

###### 23 

Behold, if the river is turbulent he is not frightened; he is confident though Jordan rushes against his mouth. 

###### 24 

Can one take him by his eyes, or pierce his nose with a snare?
