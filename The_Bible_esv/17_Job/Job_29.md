###### 1 

And Job again took up his discourse, and said: 

###### 2 

"Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me, 

###### 3 

when his lamp shone upon my head, and by his light I walked through darkness, 

###### 4 

as I was in my prime, when the friendship of God was upon my tent, 

###### 5 

when the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were all around me, 

###### 6 

when my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured out for me streams of oil! 

###### 7 

When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the square, 

###### 8 

the young men saw me and withdrew, and the aged rose and stood; 

###### 9 

the princes refrained from talking and laid their hand on their mouth; 

###### 10 

the voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth. 

###### 11 

When the ear heard, it called me blessed, and when the eye saw, it approved, 

###### 12 

because I delivered the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to help him. 

###### 13 

The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. 

###### 14 

I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban. 

###### 15 

I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame. 

###### 16 

I was a father to the needy, and I searched out the cause of him whom I did not know. 

###### 17 

I broke the fangs of the unrighteous and made him drop his prey from his teeth. 

###### 18 

Then I thought, 'I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand, 

###### 19 

my roots spread out to the waters, with the dew all night on my branches, 

###### 20 

my glory fresh with me, and my bow ever new in my hand.' 

###### 21 

"Men listened to me and waited and kept silence for my counsel. 

###### 22 

After I spoke they did not speak again, and my word dropped upon them. 

###### 23 

They waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouths as for the spring rain. 

###### 24 

I smiled on them when they had no confidence, and the light of my face they did not cast down. 

###### 25 

I chose their way and sat as chief, and I lived like a king among his troops, like one who comforts mourners.
