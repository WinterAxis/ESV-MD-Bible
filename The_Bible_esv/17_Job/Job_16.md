###### 1 


Then Job answered and said: 





###### 2 


"I have heard many such things; miserable comforters are you all. 





###### 3 


Shall windy words have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer? 





###### 4 


I also could speak as you do, if you were in my place; I could join words together against you and shake my head at you. 





###### 5 


I could strengthen you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips would assuage your pain. 





###### 6 


"If I speak, my pain is not assuaged, and if I forbear, how much of it leaves me? 





###### 7 


Surely now God has worn me out; he has made desolate all my company. 





###### 8 


And he has shriveled me up, which is a witness against me, and my leanness has risen up against me; it testifies to my face. 





###### 9 


He has torn me in his wrath and hated me; he has gnashed his teeth at me; my adversary sharpens his eyes against me. 





###### 10 


Men have gaped at me with their mouth; they have struck me insolently on the cheek; they mass themselves together against me. 





###### 11 


God gives me up to the ungodly and casts me into the hands of the wicked. 





###### 12 


I was at ease, and he broke me apart; he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces; he set me up as his target; 





###### 13 


his archers surround me. He slashes open my kidneys and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground. 





###### 14 


He breaks me with breach upon breach; he runs upon me like a warrior. 





###### 15 


I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and have laid my strength in the dust. 





###### 16 


My face is red with weeping, and on my eyelids is deep darkness, 





###### 17 


although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure. 





###### 18 


"O earth, cover not my blood, and let my cry find no resting place. 





###### 19 


Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and he who testifies for me is on high. 





###### 20 


My friends scorn me; my eye pours out tears to God, 





###### 21 


that he would argue the case of a man with God, as a son of man does with his neighbor. 





###### 22 


For when a few years have come I shall go the way from which I shall not return. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
