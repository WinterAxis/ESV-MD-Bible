###### 1 

Then Job answered and said: 

###### 2 

"Keep listening to my words, and let this be your comfort. 

###### 3 

Bear with me, and I will speak, and after I have spoken, mock on. 

###### 4 

As for me, is my complaint against man? Why should I not be impatient? 

###### 5 

Look at me and be appalled, and lay your hand over your mouth. 

###### 6 

When I remember, I am dismayed, and shuddering seizes my flesh. 

###### 7 

Why do the wicked live, reach old age, and grow mighty in power? 

###### 8 

Their offspring are established in their presence, and their descendants before their eyes. 

###### 9 

Their houses are safe from fear, and no rod of God is upon them. 

###### 10 

Their bull breeds without fail; their cow calves and does not miscarry. 

###### 11 

They send out their little boys like a flock, and their children dance. 

###### 12 

They sing to the tambourine and the lyre and rejoice to the sound of the pipe. 

###### 13 

They spend their days in prosperity, and in peace they go down to Sheol. 

###### 14 

They say to God, 'Depart from us! We do not desire the knowledge of your ways. 

###### 15 

What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit do we get if we pray to him?' 

###### 16 

Behold, is not their prosperity in their hand? The counsel of the wicked is far from me. 

###### 17 

"How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity comes upon them? That God distributes pains in his anger? 

###### 18 

That they are like straw before the wind, and like chaff that the storm carries away? 

###### 19 

You say, 'God stores up their iniquity for their children.' Let him pay it out to them, that they may know it. 

###### 20 

Let their own eyes see their destruction, and let them drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 

###### 21 

For what do they care for their houses after them, when the number of their months is cut off? 

###### 22 

Will any teach God knowledge, seeing that he judges those who are on high? 

###### 23 

One dies in his full vigor, being wholly at ease and secure, 

###### 24 

his pails full of milk and the marrow of his bones moist. 

###### 25 

Another dies in bitterness of soul, never having tasted of prosperity. 

###### 26 

They lie down alike in the dust, and the worms cover them. 

###### 27 

"Behold, I know your thoughts and your schemes to wrong me. 

###### 28 

For you say, 'Where is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?' 

###### 29 

Have you not asked those who travel the roads, and do you not accept their testimony 

###### 30 

that the evil man is spared in the day of calamity, that he is rescued in the day of wrath? 

###### 31 

Who declares his way to his face, and who repays him for what he has done? 

###### 32 

When he is carried to the grave, watch is kept over his tomb. 

###### 33 

The clods of the valley are sweet to him; all mankind follows after him, and those who go before him are innumerable. 

###### 34 

How then will you comfort me with empty nothings? There is nothing left of your answers but falsehood."
