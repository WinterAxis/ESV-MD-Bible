###### 1 

Then Job answered and said: 

###### 2 

"How you have helped him who has no power! How you have saved the arm that has no strength! 

###### 3 

How you have counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge! 

###### 4 

With whose help have you uttered words, and whose breath has come out from you? 

###### 5 

The dead tremble under the waters and their inhabitants. 

###### 6 

Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering. 

###### 7 

He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing. 

###### 8 

He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not split open under them. 

###### 9 

He covers the face of the full moon and spreads over it his cloud. 

###### 10 

He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness. 

###### 11 

The pillars of heaven tremble and are astounded at his rebuke. 

###### 12 

By his power he stilled the sea; by his understanding he shattered Rahab. 

###### 13 

By his wind the heavens were made fair; his hand pierced the fleeing serpent. 

###### 14 

Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways, and how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?"
