###### 1 

"At this also my heart trembles and leaps out of its place. 

###### 2 

Keep listening to the thunder of his voice and the rumbling that comes from his mouth. 

###### 3 

Under the whole heaven he lets it go, and his lightning to the corners of the earth. 

###### 4 

After it his voice roars; he thunders with his majestic voice, and he does not restrain the lightnings when his voice is heard. 

###### 5 

God thunders wondrously with his voice; he does great things that we cannot comprehend. 

###### 6 

For to the snow he says, 'Fall on the earth,' likewise to the downpour, his mighty downpour. 

###### 7 

He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he made may know it. 

###### 8 

Then the beasts go into their lairs, and remain in their dens. 

###### 9 

From its chamber comes the whirlwind, and cold from the scattering winds. 

###### 10 

By the breath of God ice is given, and the broad waters are frozen fast. 

###### 11 

He loads the thick cloud with moisture; the clouds scatter his lightning. 

###### 12 

They turn around and around by his guidance, to accomplish all that he commands them on the face of the habitable world. 

###### 13 

Whether for correction or for his land or for love, he causes it to happen. 

###### 14 

"Hear this, O Job; stop and consider the wondrous works of God. 

###### 15 

Do you know how God lays his command upon them and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine? 

###### 16 

Do you know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge, 

###### 17 

you whose garments are hot when the earth is still because of the south wind? 

###### 18 

Can you, like him, spread out the skies, hard as a cast metal mirror? 

###### 19 

Teach us what we shall say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of darkness. 

###### 20 

Shall it be told him that I would speak? Did a man ever wish that he would be swallowed up? 

###### 21 

"And now no one looks on the light when it is bright in the skies, when the wind has passed and cleared them. 

###### 22 

Out of the north comes golden splendor; God is clothed with awesome majesty. 

###### 23 

The Almighty--we cannot find him; he is great in power; justice and abundant righteousness he will not violate. 

###### 24 

Therefore men fear him; he does not regard any who are wise in their own conceit."
