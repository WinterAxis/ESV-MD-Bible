###### 1 

Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: 

###### 2 

"How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and then we will speak. 

###### 3 

Why are we counted as cattle? Why are we stupid in your sight? 

###### 4 

You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you, or the rock be removed out of its place? 

###### 5 

"Indeed, the light of the wicked is put out, and the flame of his fire does not shine. 

###### 6 

The light is dark in his tent, and his lamp above him is put out. 

###### 7 

His strong steps are shortened, and his own schemes throw him down. 

###### 8 

For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks on its mesh. 

###### 9 

A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare lays hold of him. 

###### 10 

A rope is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him in the path. 

###### 11 

Terrors frighten him on every side, and chase him at his heels. 

###### 12 

His strength is famished, and calamity is ready for his stumbling. 

###### 13 

It consumes the parts of his skin; the firstborn of death consumes his limbs. 

###### 14 

He is torn from the tent in which he trusted and is brought to the king of terrors. 

###### 15 

In his tent dwells that which is none of his; sulfur is scattered over his habitation. 

###### 16 

His roots dry up beneath, and his branches wither above. 

###### 17 

His memory perishes from the earth, and he has no name in the street. 

###### 18 

He is thrust from light into darkness, and driven out of the world. 

###### 19 

He has no posterity or progeny among his people, and no survivor where he used to live. 

###### 20 

They of the west are appalled at his day, and horror seizes them of the east. 

###### 21 

Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, such is the place of him who knows not God."
