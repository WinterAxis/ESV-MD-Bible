###### 1 

Then Job answered and said: 

###### 2 

"How long will you torment me and break me in pieces with words? 

###### 3 

These ten times you have cast reproach upon me; are you not ashamed to wrong me? 

###### 4 

And even if it be true that I have erred, my error remains with myself. 

###### 5 

If indeed you magnify yourselves against me and make my disgrace an argument against me, 

###### 6 

know then that God has put me in the wrong and closed his net about me. 

###### 7 

Behold, I cry out, 'Violence!' but I am not answered; I call for help, but there is no justice. 

###### 8 

He has walled up my way, so that I cannot pass, and he has set darkness upon my paths. 

###### 9 

He has stripped from me my glory and taken the crown from my head. 

###### 10 

He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone, and my hope has he pulled up like a tree. 

###### 11 

He has kindled his wrath against me and counts me as his adversary. 

###### 12 

His troops come on together; they have cast up their siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent. 

###### 13 

"He has put my brothers far from me, and those who knew me are wholly estranged from me. 

###### 14 

My relatives have failed me, my close friends have forgotten me. 

###### 15 

The guests in my house and my maidservants count me as a stranger; I have become a foreigner in their eyes. 

###### 16 

I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer; I must plead with him with my mouth for mercy. 

###### 17 

My breath is strange to my wife, and I am a stench to the children of my own mother. 

###### 18 

Even young children despise me; when I rise they talk against me. 

###### 19 

All my intimate friends abhor me, and those whom I loved have turned against me. 

###### 20 

My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth. 

###### 21 

Have mercy on me, have mercy on me, O you my friends, for the hand of God has touched me! 

###### 22 

Why do you, like God, pursue me? Why are you not satisfied with my flesh? 

###### 23 

"Oh that my words were written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book! 

###### 24 

Oh that with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever! 

###### 25 

For I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last he will stand upon the earth. 

###### 26 

And after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God, 

###### 27 

whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. My heart faints within me! 

###### 28 

If you say, 'How we will pursue him!' and, 'The root of the matter is found in him,' 

###### 29 

be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishment of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment."
