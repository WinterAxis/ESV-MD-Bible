###### 1 


"Has not man a hard service on earth, and are not his days like the days of a hired hand? 





###### 2 


Like a slave who longs for the shadow, and like a hired hand who looks for his wages, 





###### 3 


so I am allotted months of emptiness, and nights of misery are apportioned to me. 





###### 4 


When I lie down I say, 'When shall I arise?' But the night is long, and I am full of tossing till the dawn. 





###### 5 


My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt; my skin hardens, then breaks out afresh. 





###### 6 


My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle and come to their end without hope. 





###### 7 


"Remember that my life is a breath; my eye will never again see good. 





###### 8 


The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more; while your eyes are on me, I shall be gone. 





###### 9 


As the cloud fades and vanishes, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up; 





###### 10 


he returns no more to his house, nor does his place know him anymore. 





###### 11 


"Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 





###### 12 


Am I the sea, or a sea monster, that you set a guard over me? 





###### 13 


When I say, 'My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint,' 





###### 14 


then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions, 





###### 15 


so that I would choose strangling and death rather than my bones. 





###### 16 


I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a breath. 





###### 17 


What is man, that you make so much of him, and that you set your heart on him, 





###### 18 


visit him every morning and test him every moment? 





###### 19 


How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone till I swallow my spit? 





###### 20 


If I sin, what do I do to you, you watcher of mankind? Why have you made me your mark? Why have I become a burden to you? 





###### 21 


Why do you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For now I shall lie in the earth; you will seek me, but I shall not be." ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
