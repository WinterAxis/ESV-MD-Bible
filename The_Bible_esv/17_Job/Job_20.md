###### 1 

Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said: 

###### 2 

"Therefore my thoughts answer me, because of my haste within me. 

###### 3 

I hear censure that insults me, and out of my understanding a spirit answers me. 

###### 4 

Do you not know this from of old, since man was placed on earth, 

###### 5 

that the exulting of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless but for a moment? 

###### 6 

Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds, 

###### 7 

he will perish forever like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?' 

###### 8 

He will fly away like a dream and not be found; he will be chased away like a vision of the night. 

###### 9 

The eye that saw him will see him no more, nor will his place any more behold him. 

###### 10 

His children will seek the favor of the poor, and his hands will give back his wealth. 

###### 11 

His bones are full of his youthful vigor, but it will lie down with him in the dust. 

###### 12 

"Though evil is sweet in his mouth, though he hides it under his tongue, 

###### 13 

though he is loath to let it go and holds it in his mouth, 

###### 14 

yet his food is turned in his stomach; it is the venom of cobras within him. 

###### 15 

He swallows down riches and vomits them up again; God casts them out of his belly. 

###### 16 

He will suck the poison of cobras; the tongue of a viper will kill him. 

###### 17 

He will not look upon the rivers, the streams flowing with honey and curds. 

###### 18 

He will give back the fruit of his toil and will not swallow it down; from the profit of his trading he will get no enjoyment. 

###### 19 

For he has crushed and abandoned the poor; he has seized a house that he did not build. 

###### 20 

"Because he knew no contentment in his belly, he will not let anything in which he delights escape him. 

###### 21 

There was nothing left after he had eaten; therefore his prosperity will not endure. 

###### 22 

In the fullness of his sufficiency he will be in distress; the hand of everyone in misery will come against him. 

###### 23 

To fill his belly to the full, God will send his burning anger against him and rain it upon him into his body. 

###### 24 

He will flee from an iron weapon; a bronze arrow will strike him through. 

###### 25 

It is drawn forth and comes out of his body; the glittering point comes out of his gallbladder; terrors come upon him. 

###### 26 

Utter darkness is laid up for his treasures; a fire not fanned will devour him; what is left in his tent will be consumed. 

###### 27 

The heavens will reveal his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him. 

###### 28 

The possessions of his house will be carried away, dragged off in the day of God's wrath. 

###### 29 

This is the wicked man's portion from God, the heritage decreed for him by God."
