###### 1 

"Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold that they refine. 

###### 2 

Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from the ore. 

###### 3 

Man puts an end to darkness and searches out to the farthest limit the ore in gloom and deep darkness. 

###### 4 

He opens shafts in a valley away from where anyone lives; they are forgotten by travelers; they hang in the air, far away from mankind; they swing to and fro. 

###### 5 

As for the earth, out of it comes bread, but underneath it is turned up as by fire. 

###### 6 

Its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold. 

###### 7 

"That path no bird of prey knows, and the falcon's eye has not seen it. 

###### 8 

The proud beasts have not trodden it; the lion has not passed over it. 

###### 9 

"Man puts his hand to the flinty rock and overturns mountains by the roots. 

###### 10 

He cuts out channels in the rocks, and his eye sees every precious thing. 

###### 11 

He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle, and the thing that is hidden he brings out to light. 

###### 12 

"But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? 

###### 13 

Man does not know its worth, and it is not found in the land of the living. 

###### 14 

The deep says, 'It is not in me,' and the sea says, 'It is not with me.' 

###### 15 

It cannot be bought for gold, and silver cannot be weighed as its price. 

###### 16 

It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire. 

###### 17 

Gold and glass cannot equal it, nor can it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold. 

###### 18 

No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; the price of wisdom is above pearls. 

###### 19 

The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, nor can it be valued in pure gold. 

###### 20 

"From where, then, does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding? 

###### 21 

It is hidden from the eyes of all living and concealed from the birds of the air. 

###### 22 

Abaddon and Death say, 'We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.' 

###### 23 

"God understands the way to it, and he knows its place. 

###### 24 

For he looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens. 

###### 25 

When he gave to the wind its weight and apportioned the waters by measure, 

###### 26 

when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder, 

###### 27 

then he saw it and declared it; he established it, and searched it out. 

###### 28 

And he said to man, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.'"
