###### 1 

Then Job answered and said: 

###### 2 

"No doubt you are the people, and wisdom will die with you. 

###### 3 

But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these? 

###### 4 

I am a laughingstock to my friends; I, who called to God and he answered me, a just and blameless man, am a laughingstock. 

###### 5 

In the thought of one who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; it is ready for those whose feet slip. 

###### 6 

The tents of robbers are at peace, and those who provoke God are secure, who bring their god in their hand. 

###### 7 

"But ask the beasts, and they will teach you; the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you; 

###### 8 

or the bushes of the earth, and they will teach you; and the fish of the sea will declare to you. 

###### 9 

Who among all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this? 

###### 10 

In his hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind. 

###### 11 

Does not the ear test words as the palate tastes food? 

###### 12 

Wisdom is with the aged, and understanding in length of days. 

###### 13 

"With God are wisdom and might; he has counsel and understanding. 

###### 14 

If he tears down, none can rebuild; if he shuts a man in, none can open. 

###### 15 

If he withholds the waters, they dry up; if he sends them out, they overwhelm the land. 

###### 16 

With him are strength and sound wisdom; the deceived and the deceiver are his. 

###### 17 

He leads counselors away stripped, and judges he makes fools. 

###### 18 

He looses the bonds of kings and binds a waistcloth on their hips. 

###### 19 

He leads priests away stripped and overthrows the mighty. 

###### 20 

He deprives of speech those who are trusted and takes away the discernment of the elders. 

###### 21 

He pours contempt on princes and loosens the belt of the strong. 

###### 22 

He uncovers the deeps out of darkness and brings deep darkness to light. 

###### 23 

He makes nations great, and he destroys them; he enlarges nations, and leads them away. 

###### 24 

He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth and makes them wander in a trackless waste. 

###### 25 

They grope in the dark without light, and he makes them stagger like a drunken man.
