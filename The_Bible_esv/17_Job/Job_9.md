###### 1 


Then Job answered and said: 





###### 2 


"Truly I know that it is so: But how can a man be in the right before God? 





###### 3 


If one wished to contend with him, one could not answer him once in a thousand times. 





###### 4 


He is wise in heart and mighty in strength --who has hardened himself against him, and succeeded?-- 





###### 5 


he who removes mountains, and they know it not, when he overturns them in his anger, 





###### 6 


who shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble; 





###### 7 


who commands the sun, and it does not rise; who seals up the stars; 





###### 8 


who alone stretched out the heavens and trampled the waves of the sea; 





###### 9 


who made the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the chambers of the south; 





###### 10 


who does great things beyond searching out, and marvelous things beyond number. 





###### 11 


Behold, he passes by me, and I see him not; he moves on, but I do not perceive him. 





###### 12 


Behold, he snatches away; who can turn him back? Who will say to him, 'What are you doing?' 





###### 13 


"God will not turn back his anger; beneath him bowed the helpers of Rahab. 





###### 14 


How then can I answer him, choosing my words with him? 





###### 15 


Though I am in the right, I cannot answer him; I must appeal for mercy to my accuser. 





###### 16 


If I summoned him and he answered me, I would not believe that he was listening to my voice. 





###### 17 


For he crushes me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause; 





###### 18 


he will not let me get my breath, but fills me with bitterness. 





###### 19 


If it is a contest of strength, behold, he is mighty! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon him? 





###### 20 


Though I am in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; though I am blameless, he would prove me perverse. 





###### 21 


I am blameless; I regard not myself; I loathe my life. 





###### 22 


It is all one; therefore I say, 'He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.' 





###### 23 


When disaster brings sudden death, he mocks at the calamity of the innocent. 





###### 24 


The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; he covers the faces of its judges-- if it is not he, who then is it? 





###### 25 


"My days are swifter than a runner; they flee away; they see no good. 





###### 26 


They go by like skiffs of reed, like an eagle swooping on the prey. 





###### 27 


If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and be of good cheer,' 





###### 28 


I become afraid of all my suffering, for I know you will not hold me innocent. 





###### 29 


I shall be condemned; why then do I labor in vain? 





###### 30 


If I wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye, 





###### 31 


yet you will plunge me into a pit, and my own clothes will abhor me. 





###### 32 


For he is not a man, as I am, that I might answer him, that we should come to trial together. 





###### 33 


There is no arbiter between us, who might lay his hand on us both. 





###### 34 


Let him take his rod away from me, and let not dread of him terrify me. 





###### 35 


Then I would speak without fear of him, for I am not so in myself. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
