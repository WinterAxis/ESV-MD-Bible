###### 1 

Then Elihu answered and said: 

###### 2 

"Hear my words, you wise men, and give ear to me, you who know; 

###### 3 

for the ear tests words as the palate tastes food. 

###### 4 

Let us choose what is right; let us know among ourselves what is good. 

###### 5 

For Job has said, 'I am in the right, and God has taken away my right; 

###### 6 

in spite of my right I am counted a liar; my wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.' 

###### 7 

What man is like Job, who drinks up scoffing like water, 

###### 8 

who travels in company with evildoers and walks with wicked men? 

###### 9 

For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing that he should take delight in God.' 

###### 10 

"Therefore, hear me, you men of understanding: far be it from God that he should do wickedness, and from the Almighty that he should do wrong. 

###### 11 

For according to the work of a man he will repay him, and according to his ways he will make it befall him. 

###### 12 

Of a truth, God will not do wickedly, and the Almighty will not pervert justice. 

###### 13 

Who gave him charge over the earth, and who laid on him the whole world? 

###### 14 

If he should set his heart to it and gather to himself his spirit and his breath, 

###### 15 

all flesh would perish together, and man would return to dust. 

###### 16 

"If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say. 

###### 17 

Shall one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty, 

###### 18 

who says to a king, 'Worthless one,' and to nobles, 'Wicked man,' 

###### 19 

who shows no partiality to princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor, for they are all the work of his hands? 

###### 20 

In a moment they die; at midnight the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away by no human hand. 

###### 21 

"For his eyes are on the ways of a man, and he sees all his steps. 

###### 22 

There is no gloom or deep darkness where evildoers may hide themselves. 

###### 23 

For God has no need to consider a man further, that he should go before God in judgment. 

###### 24 

He shatters the mighty without investigation and sets others in their place. 

###### 25 

Thus, knowing their works, he overturns them in the night, and they are crushed. 

###### 26 

He strikes them for their wickedness in a place for all to see, 

###### 27 

because they turned aside from following him and had no regard for any of his ways, 

###### 28 

so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heard the cry of the afflicted-- 

###### 29 

When he is quiet, who can condemn? When he hides his face, who can behold him, whether it be a nation or a man?-- 

###### 30 

that a godless man should not reign, that he should not ensnare the people. 

###### 31 

"For has anyone said to God, 'I have borne punishment; I will not offend any more; 

###### 32 

teach me what I do not see; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more'? 

###### 33 

Will he then make repayment to suit you, because you reject it? For you must choose, and not I; therefore declare what you know. 

###### 34 

Men of understanding will say to me, and the wise man who hears me will say: 

###### 35 

'Job speaks without knowledge; his words are without insight.' 

###### 36 

Would that Job were tried to the end, because he answers like wicked men. 

###### 37 

For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God."
