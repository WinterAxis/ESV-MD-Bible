###### 1 


And Elihu continued, and said: 





###### 2 


"Bear with me a little, and I will show you, for I have yet something to say on God's behalf. 





###### 3 


I will get my knowledge from afar and ascribe righteousness to my Maker. 





###### 4 


For truly my words are not false; one who is perfect in knowledge is with you. 





###### 5 


"Behold, God is mighty, and does not despise any; he is mighty in strength of understanding. 





###### 6 


He does not keep the wicked alive, but gives the afflicted their right. 





###### 7 


He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne he sets them forever, and they are exalted. 





###### 8 


And if they are bound in chains and caught in the cords of affliction, 





###### 9 


then he declares to them their work and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly. 





###### 10 


He opens their ears to instruction and commands that they return from iniquity. 





###### 11 


If they listen and serve him, they complete their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasantness. 





###### 12 


But if they do not listen, they perish by the sword and die without knowledge. 





###### 13 


"The godless in heart cherish anger; they do not cry for help when he binds them. 





###### 14 


They die in youth, and their life ends among the cult prostitutes. 





###### 15 


He delivers the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ear by adversity. 





###### 16 


He also allured you out of distress into a broad place where there was no cramping, and what was set on your table was full of fatness. 





###### 17 


"But you are full of the judgment on the wicked; judgment and justice seize you. 





###### 18 


Beware lest wrath entice you into scoffing, and let not the greatness of the ransom turn you aside. 





###### 19 


Will your cry for help avail to keep you from distress, or all the force of your strength? 





###### 20 


Do not long for the night, when peoples vanish in their place. 





###### 21 


Take care; do not turn to iniquity, for this you have chosen rather than affliction. 





###### 22 


Behold, God is exalted in his power; who is a teacher like him? 





###### 23 


Who has prescribed for him his way, or who can say, 'You have done wrong'? 





###### 24 


"Remember to extol his work, of which men have sung. 





###### 25 


All mankind has looked on it; man beholds it from afar. 





###### 26 


Behold, God is great, and we know him not; the number of his years is unsearchable. 





###### 27 


For he draws up the drops of water; they distill his mist in rain, 





###### 28 


which the skies pour down and drop on mankind abundantly. 





###### 29 


Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion? 





###### 30 


Behold, he scatters his lightning about him and covers the roots of the sea. 





###### 31 


For by these he judges peoples; he gives food in abundance. 





###### 32 


He covers his hands with the lightning and commands it to strike the mark. 





###### 33 


Its crashing declares his presence; the cattle also declare that he rises. ## About ## Help ## Our Network ## Social ## Preferences By submitting your email address, you understand that you will receive email communications from Bible Gateway, a division of The Zondervan Corporation, 3900 Sparks Drive SE, Grand Rapids, MI 49546 USA, including commercial communications and messages from partners of Bible Gateway.
